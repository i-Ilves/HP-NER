The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.",

She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape \u2014 Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast \u2014 \u201cMinerva!\u201d said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear. \u201cNo!\u201d squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no more murder at Hogwarts!\u201d",

Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, \u201cCoward! COWARD!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, what\u2019s happened?\u201d asked Luna.

He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass.

He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder\u2019s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron\u2019s or Hermione\u2019s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them.

        "Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d \u201cHere!\u201d Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . .",

        "Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred\u2019s body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way. \u201cHere,\u201d said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \u201cROOKWOOD!\u201d and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. \u201cHarry, in here!\u201d Hermione screamed.",

Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.",

And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate.

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding.

Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape\u2019s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . . The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.",

Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him. The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape. Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. \u201cSlytherin!\u201d cried the Sorting Hat. And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . .",

Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape\u2019s defense.

Branches caught at Harry\u2019s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . . The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. \u201cBANE!\u201d",

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.",

Fight!\u201d They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.

Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.",

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.

All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other\u2019s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, \u201cAnd let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part!

The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father\u2019s arm.",

The first years\u2019 faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House he belonged.",

        "In times of old when I was new And Hogwarts barely started The founders of our noble school Thought never to be parted: United by a common goal, They had the selfsame yearning, To make the world\u2019s best magic school And pass along their learning. \u201cTogether we will build and teach!\u201d The four good friends decided And never did they dream that they Might someday be divided, For were there such friends anywhere As Slytherin and Gryffindor? Unless it was the second pair Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw? So how could it have gone so wrong? How could such friendships fail? Why, I was there and so can tell The whole sad, sorry tale. Said Slytherin, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach just those Whose ancestry is purest.\u201d Said Ravenclaw, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach those whose Intelligence is surest.\u201d Said Gryffindor, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach all those With brave deeds to their name.\u201d Said Hufflepuff, \u201cI\u2019ll teach the lot, And treat them just the same.\u201d These differences caused little strife When first they came to light, For each of the four founders had A House in which they might Take only those they wanted, so, For instance, Slytherin Took only pure-blood wizards Of great cunning, just like him, And only those of sharpest mind Were taught by Ravenclaw While the bravest and the boldest Went to daring Gryffindor. Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest, And taught them all she knew, Thus the Houses and their founders Retained friendships firm and true. So Hogwarts worked in harmony For several happy years, But then discord crept among us Feeding on our faults and fears. The Houses that, like pillars four, Had once held up our school, Now turned upon each other and, Divided, sought to rule. And for a while it seemed the school Must meet an early end, What with dueling and with fighting And the clash of friend on friend And at last there came a morning When old Slytherin departed And though the fighting then died out He left us quite downhearted. And never since the founders four Were whittled down to three Have the Houses been united As they once were meant to be. And now the Sorting Hat is here And you all know the score: I sort you into Houses Because that is what I\u2019m for, But this year I\u2019ll go further, Listen closely to my song: Though condemned I am to split you Still I worry that it\u2019s wrong, Though I must fulfill my duty And must quarter every year Still I wonder whether Sorting May not bring the end I fear. Oh, know the perils, read the signs, The warning history shows, For our Hogwarts is in danger From external, deadly foes And we must unite inside her Or we\u2019ll crumble from within. I have told you, I have warned you. . . . Let the Sorting now begin.",

Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent. Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus. Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged?",

Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked. . . .

His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, \u201cAsk us no questions and we\u2019ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C\u2019mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.\u201d",

The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione\u2019s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.

She was busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly\u0002scented fire that she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows.

Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we\u2019ve got a month\u2019s dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren\u2019t wrong about O.W.L. year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .\u201d",

        "inner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him \u2014 on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story firsthand. \u201cHe says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered . . .\u201d \u201cHe reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who . . .\u201d \u201cCome off it . . .\u201d",

Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted. \u201cHow can Dumbledore have let this happen?\u201d Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.

Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls\u2019 dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats. \u201cThey should at least see what they\u2019re picking up,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnyway . . .\u201d He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape\u2019s essay. \u201cThere\u2019s no point trying to finish this now, I can\u2019t do it without Hermione, I haven\u2019t got a clue what you\u2019re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?\u201d Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morning came, he piled his books back into his bag.",

If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I\u2019m afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!\u201d They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of Charms homework ever.",

I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.\u201d Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. \u201cYes, you too, Longbottom,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So  .  .  . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.\u201d She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall.

Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered. \u201cOooooh!\u201d said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast\u0002Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so. \u201cKindly keep your voices down, girls!\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. \u201cSo \u2014 anyone know the names of these creatures?

So whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you\u2019d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle \u2014 I have enough here for one between three \u2014 you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.\u201d",

When he knocked on the door she said, \u201cCome in,\u201d in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around. He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody\u2019s days it had been packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment. Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large Technicolored kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again. \u201cGood evening, Mr. Potter.\u201d",

He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they healed over seconds later. And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment. Darkness fell outside Umbridge\u2019s window.

He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill. . . .",

        "Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron\u2019s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts. At five o\u2019clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge\u2019s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it. \u201cYou know what to do, Mr. Potter,\u201d said Umbridge, smiling sweetly over at him.",

On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance. I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh. I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting. I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist. He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn\u2019t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with blood.",

He comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I\u2019m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper\u2019s a real whiner, he\u2019s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky\u2019s involved in all sorts of societies, she admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she\u2019d put Charms first. Anyway, we\u2019re having a practice session at two o\u2019clock tomorrow, so just make sure you\u2019re there this time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?\u201d",

The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig. \u201cThere you are,\u201d he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. \u201cGet down here, I\u2019ve got a letter for you.\u201d With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down onto his shoulder.",

The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl\u2019s, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird.

Maybe they\u2019ve just made something up to get him!\u201d There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this.

Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn\u2019t doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind. They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered. \u201cAll right, Ron?\u201d said George, winking at him. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch. \u201cReady to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?\u201d said Fred, emerging tousle\u0002haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face.",

Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it. The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful. \u201cPass it on, Ron,\u201d called Angelina, as though nothing had happened. Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George. . . .",

They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull. \u201cYou know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\u201d Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall\u2019s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra\u2019s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter\u2019s moons.",

Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this \u2014 no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore\u2019s favorite \u2014 but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different \u2014 and probably more accurate \u2014 view of Potter\u2019s behavior.

        "Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people I\u2019ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt. It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter \u2014 I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent \u2014 but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter\u2019s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will be only too happy to advise you.",

        "This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore\u2019s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week \u2014 again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this \u2014 a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years!",

        "I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore\u2019s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people \u2014 the Minister really could not be more gracious to me \u2014 and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents\u2019 beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes. Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect. Your brother,",

Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.",

She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \u201cWe shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\u201d she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \u201cDivide into pairs, please, and interpret each other\u2019s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\u201d She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati\u2019s most recent dream.",

        "Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney\u2019s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. \u201cThink of a dream, quick,\u201d he told Ron, \u201cin case the old toad comes our way.\u201d \u201cI did it last time,\u201d Ron protested, \u201cit\u2019s your turn, you tell me one.\u201d \u201cOh, I dunno  .  .  .\u201d said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \u201cLet\u2019s say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that\u2019ll do . . .\u201d Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be \u2018drowning\u2019 or \u2018cauldron\u2019 or \u2018Snape\u2019?\u201d",

        "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, pick any of them,\u201d said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney\u2019s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \u201cWhat night did you dream this again?\u201d Ron said, immersed in calculations. \u201cI dunno, last night, whenever you like,\u201d Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \u201cNow,\u201d said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \u201cyou\u2019ve been in this post how long, exactly?\u201d Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \u201cNearly sixteen years.\u201d \u201cQuite a period,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \u201cSo it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \u201cAnd you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \u201cBut I think \u2014 correct me if I am mistaken \u2014 that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\u201d \u201cThese things often skip \u2014 er \u2014 three generations,\u201d said Professor Trelawney.",

Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.",

        "It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge\u2019s office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \u201cHere,\u201d she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \u201csoak your hand in that, it\u2019s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\u201d Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks\u2019s ears with his left hand. \u201cI still reckon you should complain about this,\u201d said Ron in a low voice. \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly.",

A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of a wild boar\u2019s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door. \u201cWell, come on,\u201d said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.",

The Hog\u2019s Head bar comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.",

        "Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: \u201cYeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head,\u201d he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon\u2019s egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog\u2019s Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.",

We\u2019re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog\u2019s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses.

        "He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, discussing Angelina\u2019s idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night\u2019s Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people. A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so large that it covered everything else on there \u2014 the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys\u2019 new advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-and-found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.",

Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him back. \u201cPotter!\u201d \u201cYes, Professor?\u201d She glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions. \u201cBear in mind,\u201d she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, \u201cthat channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI \u2014\u201d said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them and found five words in Sirius\u2019s handwriting:",

Ron hurried forward and seized Neville\u2019s arms; together, he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Neville\u2019s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.",

But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it \u2014 tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it \u2014 I don\u2019t think Filch would object, when\u2019s he ever stuck up for a student\u2019s rights? Harry, you\u2019re squashing your frog.\u201d Harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk. \u201cIt was a very, very close call last night,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was.

At half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand.

Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them. \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand. \u201cI DID IT!\u201d said Neville gleefully. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it before \u2014 I DID IT!\u201d",

Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back. \u201cSorry, Harry,\u201d said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye.",

The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see their side\u2019s victory. Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.",

Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood\u2019s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland\u2019s top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured Ron they had been trying to deny for four years.",

When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, \u201cGot your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?\u201d he did not laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of each other), Ron\u2019s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.",

Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we\u2019d bin hidin\u2019 in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin\u2019 our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o\u2019 the caves, no go \u2014 then, in abou\u2019 the sixth one, we found three giants hidin\u2019.\u201d \u201cCave must\u2019ve been cramped,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWasn\u2019 room ter swing a kneazle,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cDidn\u2019t they attack you when they saw you?\u201d asked Hermione. \u201cProbably woulda done if they\u2019d bin in any condition,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut they was badly hurt, all three o\u2019 them. Golgomath\u2019s lot had beaten \u2019em unconscious; they\u2019d woken up an\u2019 crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o\u2019 them had a bit of English an\u2019 \u2019e translated fer the others, an\u2019 what we had ter say didn\u2019 seem ter go down too badly. So we kep\u2019 goin\u2019 back, visitin\u2019 the wounded.  .  .  . I reckon we had abou\u2019 six or seven o\u2019 them convinced at one poin\u2019.\u201d",

        "\u201cHagrid, hide our mugs!\u201d Hagrid seized Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang\u2019s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid\u2019s face; she barely reached his navel. \u201cSo,\u201d she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \u201cYou\u2019re Hagrid, are you?\u201d Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. \u201cGet away,\u201d she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. \u201cEr \u2014 I don\u2019 want ter be rude,\u201d said Hagrid, staring at her, \u201cbut who the ruddy hell are you?\u201d",

        "INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley\u2019s resignation. \u201cWeasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\u201d Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \u201cHe is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\u201d Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she\u2019d set the family ghoul on them. \u201cWell?\u201d said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny?\u201d",
