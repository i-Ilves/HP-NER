CHAPTER  NINETEEN

ELF TAILS

o, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained,
the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and
Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the
double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out.
Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and George
had arrived at ten past.

“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said George
grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside cabinet and
sitting beside Ginny.
“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,” said Fred.
“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him —” said George.
“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up.
“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily. “A
Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot
aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore.  .  .  . But never
mind that now.”

He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
“How exactly did it happen, Harry?”
Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred
times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione,
and to Ginny.

“. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up
a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up,
and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he’ll be all right. Madam
Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week or so . . . keep taking essence
of rue . . .”

“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said George in a low
voice.

“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turning cold at
the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay
hands on the little stone.
Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally
quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital
wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no
part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been
poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightenedlooking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.
“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny.

“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago — they’re in
Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be back soon. . . .”
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his
sleep.

“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for
the opportunity to start discussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out —”
“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass without you
seeing?”

“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?”
“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he could have mixed up
the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?”
“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked Ginny.
“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of people who’d like to
poison Harry, mustn’t there? ‘The Chosen One’ and all that?”
“So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny.
“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly.

“He could be under the Imperius Curse,” said George.
“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison could have been in
the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.”
“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”

“Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,” said
Harry. “Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And
.  . .” He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to
extract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way,
maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.”

“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to
Dumbledore for Christmas,” Ginny reminded him. “So the poisoner could
just as easily have been after Dumbledore.”

“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said Hermione,
speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad
head cold. “Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a
good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself.”

“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them.
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering
incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came
striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping
behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized
footprints all over the floor.

“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, I bin readin’ to
him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ now an’ then Professor Sprout told
me abou’ Ron! How is he?”

“Not bad,” said Harry. “They say he’ll be okay.”
“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out
of her office.

“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out.
“Oh  .  .  . yes .  .  .” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been
counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her
confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand.
“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head
as he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ don’ believe it  .  .  . Look at him lyin’
there. . . . Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?”

“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.”
“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team,
could they?” said Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . .”
“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George.
“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,”
said Fred fairly.

“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection
between the attacks,” said Hermione quietly.
“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.

“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t,
although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the
necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed.
Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this even
more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many
people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.”

Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, the
dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the
ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make
a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold
of Harry and hugged him very tightly. “Dumbledore’s told us how you
saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, Harry, what can we say? You
saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur . . . now you’ve saved Ron . . .”

“Don’t be . . . I didn’t . . .” muttered Harry awkwardly.
“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think
about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that
it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your
compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.”

Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when
Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six
visitors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to leave and
Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.

“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked
back along the corridor to the marble staircase. “All this new security, an’
kids are still gettin’ hurt. . . . Dumbledore’s worried sick. . . . He don’ say
much, but I can tell. . . .”

“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?” asked Hermione desperately.
“I ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” said Hagrid. “But he
doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or
they’d’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid,
lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure,
checked the ceiling for Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if
kids are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll
be panic, more parents takin’ their kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh
know the board o’ governors . . .”

Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted
serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, “.  .  . the board o’
governors’ll be talkin’ about shuttin’ us up fer good.”

“Surely not?” said Hermione, looking worried.
“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid heavily. “I mean, it’s
always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect
accidents, don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up
tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s diff’rent. ’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s
angry with Sn —”

Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was
visible of his face above his tangled black beard.
“What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with Snape?”

“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have
been a bigger giveaway. “Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I
need ter —”

“Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” Harry asked loudly.
“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. “Don’ shout stuff
like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d
care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag —”

“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” said Harry forcefully.
“What’s Snape done?”

“I dunno, Harry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I was comin’ outta
the forest the other evenin’ an’ I overheard ’em talking — well, arguin’.
Didn’t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried not ter
listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it
out.”

“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took too much fer
granted an’ maybe he — Snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore —”
“Do what?”

“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha’s
all — anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that
was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An’ then he said summat abou’
Snape makin’ investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’
strange abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione
exchanged looks full of meaning. “All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter
look inter that necklace business —”

“Yeah, but Dumbledore’s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?”
said Harry

“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there
was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. “I know what yeh’re
like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this
than there is.”

“Look out,” said Hermione tersely.
They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over
the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner,
hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.

“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean detention!”
“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with me, aren’ they?”
“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch obnoxiously.
“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Hagrid, firing up
at once.

There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris
had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch’s
skinny ankles.

“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.
Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off;
Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They
passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking
happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,
When there’s strife and when there’s trouble
Call on Peevsie, he’ll make double!

The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung
forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and
empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet;
Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day.
Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry,
however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down
into the dying embers.

So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry,
in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his
temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to
investigate the Slytherins . . . or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin:
Malfoy?

Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to
take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in
Harry’s suspicions? That seemed likely. It might even be that Dumbledore
did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from
procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it
right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. . . .
“There you are, Potter!”

Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been
quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all
prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer
look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.

“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disregarding
Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking
Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”

It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking
about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt
of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah . . . he might
not make it.”

“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had
certainly performed second-best in the trials.
“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So when’s practice?”
“What? Oh . . . there’s one tomorrow evening.”

“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got some
ideas on strategy you might find useful.”
“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear them tomorrow,
then. I’m pretty tired now . . . see you . . .”

The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did
not cause the sensation that Katie’s attack had done. People seemed to think
that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions
master’s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote
immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were
generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against
Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played
Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary
during the opening match against Slytherin.

Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was
rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the
Marauder’s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to
wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing
anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times
when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .

But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with
Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged
wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.

He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept
up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper
for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play
regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was
also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed
training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him
who was Captain.

Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which
Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures. At
first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her
that Ron was in the hospital wing — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but
unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory
and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron’s feelings, a
most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.
“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked, after a
particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from
precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not
Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be
“serious.”

“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said
Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every
time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news
of Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as
possible.

“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.
“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry
uncomfortably.

“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender scornfully. “She didn’t
talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she
wants to make up with him now he’s all interesting.  . . . ”
“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked Harry.

“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about
Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door
pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take
him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could
follow him.

On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry
dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was
very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the
match, feeling it would overexcite him.

“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry nervously, apparently
forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.
“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be world-class and I
wouldn’t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he
thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can’t wait to
be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,” Harry added,
getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to
be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She’s driving me mad as well.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.”

“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said Harry.
“Yeah  .  .  . well  .  .  . it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He paused.
“Hermione going to look in before the match?” he added casually.
“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, good luck. Hope you
hammer McLag — I mean, Smith.”

“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you after the match.”
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was
outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He
was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind
they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw
Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom
looked sulky and resentful.

Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless
laugh and continued walking.
“Where’re you going?” Harry demanded.

“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your business, Potter,”
sneered Malfoy. “You’d better hurry up, they’ll be waiting for ‘the Chosen
Captain’ — ‘the Boy Who Scored’ — whatever they call you these days.”
One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She
blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a
trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.

Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was
infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet
there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent:
Harry’s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent
seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at
the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .

“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the
changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and
Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their
legs.

“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over
his head.
“So?”

“So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of
girlfriends while everyone else is down here. . . .”
“Does it matter right now?”
“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, seizing his Firebolt
and pushing his glasses straight. “Come on then!”
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening
cheers and boos.

There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there
were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the team. “Coote,
Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don’t see you coming —”
“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,” said
Harry angrily. “Just get up by the goalposts!”

Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.
“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudgingly.
He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam
Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his
team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it
good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle,
seize the Marauder’s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .

“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy voice,
echoing over the grounds. “He did the commentary last time, of course, and
Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it.
Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now
he’s playing them — oh, look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him,
I do like her, she’s very nice. . . .”

Harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. Surely nobody in their
right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from
above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace
of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking
slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts
about this appointment.

“. . . but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t
remember his name, it’s something like Bibble — no, Buggins —”
“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna.
The crowd laughed.

Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments
later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny
for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had
not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing
and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face
his Keeper.

“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen shouted back, red-faced
and furious.

“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,” said
Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd
cheered and jeered. “I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but
maybe it’s a clever ruse. . . .”

Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again,
scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.

Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad
supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored
again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she
appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and
kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly
shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far
failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was
suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.”

“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor McGonagall into Luna’s
megaphone.

“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper’s
got hold of one of the Beater’s bats.”
Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best
known to himself, had pulled Peakes’s bat from him and appeared to be
demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.
“Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts!” roared
Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe
at the Bludger and mishit it.

A blinding, sickening pain . . . a flash of light . . . distant screams . . . and
the sensation of falling down a long tunnel . . .

And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and
comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of
golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There
on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning.

Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital
wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must
have finished hours ago . . . as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry’s
head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of
bandages.

“What happened?”
“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back
against his pillows. “Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I’m
keeping you in overnight. You shouldn’t overexert yourself for a few
hours.”

“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry angrily, sitting up and
throwing back his covers. “I want to find McLaggen and kill him.”
“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion,’” said
Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her
wand in a threatening manner. “You will stay here until I discharge you,
Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.”
She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows,
fuming.

“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through clenched
teeth.

“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score was three
hundred and twenty to sixty.”

“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! When I get hold of
McLaggen —”

“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said Ron
reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with
that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve
dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not happy. . . .”

There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s voice; Harry could
tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly.
Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently
mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath
all the bandaging.

“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice now
shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . .
Loser’s Lurgy . . .”

But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and
after a while Ron’s snorts subsided.

“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a
long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly
constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form,
confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his
blessing. . . . “She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How
come? You left here early enough.”

“Oh . . .” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded. “Yeah . . .
well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like
they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made sure he
isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the
last match too, remember?” Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him now, the
match was such a fiasco. . . .”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t have missed a
Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you’re the Captain!”
“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Harry. “And don’t tell me it’s all
in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape —”

“I never said it was all in your head,” said Ron, hoisting himself up on an
elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, “but there’s no rule saying only one
person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re getting a bit
obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to
follow him . . .”

“I want to catch him at it!” said Harry in frustration. “I mean, where’s he
going when he disappears off the map?”
“I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning.
“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the
map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?”

“Well then, I dunno,” said Ron.
Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight
above him, thinking. . . .

If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been able to set
a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of
Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something
up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be
missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .

There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. After a while Madam
Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It
was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all
the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed,
and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew
that she was off to bed.

This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been
brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had
fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and
the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the
incurably inept Professor Lockhart.  .  .  . That had been his most painful
injury by far . . . he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones
in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor
in the middle of the —”

Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He
had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how
could he have forgotten, why hadn’t he thought of it before?
But the question was, how to call him? What did you do?
Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.
“Kreacher?”

There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks
filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.
“What’s going — ?”

Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office
and muttered, “Muffliato!” so that she would not come running. Then he
scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on.
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the
dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats,
the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there
was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above
the wrestling elves.

“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the
fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. “Look at the ickle creatures
squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy —”
“Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won’t, or
Dobby will shut Kreacher’s mouth for him!” cried Dobby in a high-pitched
voice.

“— kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of chalk at
the elves to enrage them further. “Tweaky, pokey!”
“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a
master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s
mistress say — ?”

Exactly what Kreacher’s mistress would have said they did not find out,
for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher’s mouth
and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their
beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and
kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the
lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his
earsies —”

Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlock!” Peeves clutched
at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures
but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to
the roof of his mouth.

“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his
flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. “That was another
Prince hex, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah,” said Harry, twisting Kreacher’s wizened arm into a half nelson.
“Right — I’m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re
forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you
orders —”

“Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby
will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!” said Dobby, tears now
streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.
“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who
fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.

“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he
gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.
“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey’s office door
to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that
she had heard any of the commotion. “I’ve got a job for you.”

“Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said Kreacher, sinking so low
that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no
choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes —”
“Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized
eyes still swimming in tears. “Dobby would be honored to help Harry
Potter!”

“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said Harry.
“Okay then . . . I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.”
Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s face,
Harry went on, “I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and
what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.”

“Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with
excitement. “And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the
topmost tower, Harry Potter!”

“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily.
“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?” croaked
Kreacher. “Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of
my old mistress?”

“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining
to prevent it immediately. “And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher,
or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him
messages or . . . or to contact him in any way. Got it?”

He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the
instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and
to Harry’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with
bitter resentment, “Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey
him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy
boy, oh yes. . . .”

“That’s settled, then,” said Harry. “I’ll want regular reports, but make
sure I’m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione
are okay. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like
a couple of wart plasters.”


CHAPTER  TWENTY

LORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST

arry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning,
restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and
now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned,
the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione
even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that
Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry’s chest
suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.

“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound casual as they
turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small
girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked
terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy
brass scales she was carrying.

“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. “Here
. . .”

She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, “Reparo.” The girl
did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and
watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.
“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said.

“Never mind her,” said Harry, a little impatiently. “What did Ginny and
Dean row about, Hermione?”

“Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,”
said Hermione.

“It must’ve looked funny,” said Ron reasonably.
“It didn’t look funny at all!” said Hermione hotly. “It looked terrible and
if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught Harry he could have been very badly
hurt!”

“Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,”
said Harry, still trying to sound casual. “Or are they still together?”
“Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” asked Hermione,
giving Harry a sharp look.

“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily,
but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when
a voice behind them called, “Harry!” giving him an excuse to turn his back
on her.

“Oh, hi, Luna.”
“I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, rummaging in her
bag. “But they said you’d left. . . .”

She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool,
and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands,
finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to
Harry.

“. . . I’ve been told to give you this.”
It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as
another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.

“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.
“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the
green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.
“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. “Everyone says I was
dreadful.”

“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t remember enjoying
commentary more! What is this, by the way?” he added, holding the
onionlike object up to eye level.

“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool
back into her bag. “You can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them.
They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.”
And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the
Gurdyroot.

“You know, she’s grown on me, Luna,” he said, as they set off again for
the Great Hall. “I know she’s insane, but it’s in a good —”
He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the
foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.
“Hi,” said Ron nervously.

“C’mon,” Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not
before they had heard Lavender say, “Why didn’t you tell me you were
getting out today? And why was she with you?”

Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half
an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them
exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as
though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an
inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a
particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even
consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry’s Herbology
essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point,
because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.

“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back
as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen,
I’ve got to hurry or I’ll be late for Dumbledore. . . .”

She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences
in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole
and off to the headmaster’s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention
of toffee éclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time,
knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.

“Enter,” called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door,
it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.
“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him
through her magnifying spectacles. “So this is the reason I am to be thrown
unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!”

“My dear Sybill,” said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice,
“there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but
Harry does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more
to be said —”

“Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. “If
you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a
school where my talents are better appreciated. . . .”
She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they
heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped
over one of her trailing shawls.

“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said Dumbledore, sounding
rather tired.

Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore’s
desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny
crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is teaching, then?” Harry
asked.

“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to be much more
trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself.
I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor
can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of
the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know — and I
think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy
about you and Voldemort, you see.”

Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But never mind my staffing
problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have
you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?”
“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and
Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his
determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost
forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from
Professor Slughorn. “Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of
Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.”
There was a little silence.

“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his
half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was
being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts
in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable
ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest
to retrieve the memory?”

“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to
get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well . . .
the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor
Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough
mood —”

“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”

“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the
memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in
danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full
recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set
you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is.
Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial
memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.”

A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all
the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not
even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold
disappointment was worse than anything.

“Sir,” he said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or
anything, I’ve just had other — other things . . .”
“Other things on your mind,” Dumbledore finished the sentence for him.
“I see.”

Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry
had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on,
punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando
Dippet over Dumbledore’s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though
he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it
no longer he said, “Professor Dumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have
done more. . . . I should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it
if it wasn’t really important.”

“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “May I
hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on?
There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that
memory.”

“I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly.
“Then we shall say no more about it just now,” said Dumbledore more
kindly, “but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where
that was?”

“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his father and his
grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he
went back to Hogwarts and he asked . . . he asked Professor Slughorn about
Horcruxes,” he mumbled shamefacedly.

“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, you will remember, I hope, that I
told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be
entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?”
“Yes, sir.”

“Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources
of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of
seventeen?”
Harry nodded.

“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things become murkier and
stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been
almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man
Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself,
who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts.
However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.”
Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the
Pensieve. “I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the
conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.”

The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel
even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the
Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised
the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.

“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s memories, for they
are curious recollections, these two,” he said. “This first one came from a
very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey
witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.

“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have
expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his
classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left
Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle,
prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School.

I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested
that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him
in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff
knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”

“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned.
“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. “I think you will
see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey’s
memory. But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job. Hardly anyone
knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster
confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked
whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.”

“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.
“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to
Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly,
Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever
been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and
only place he had felt at home.”

Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how
he felt about Hogwarts too.

“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly
Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the
students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were
still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.

“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence
over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from
Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had
demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for
an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at
Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a
place where he might begin to build himself an army.”

“But he didn’t get the job, sir?”
“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at
eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to
teach.”

“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry hesitantly.
“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised Armando against the
appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor
Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did
not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a
position of power.”

“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”
Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old
professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts
for nearly fifty years.

“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had
admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,
working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and
handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that
only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you
know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort
was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the
partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.”
“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.

“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. “And now it is time to
hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch
by the name of Hepzibah Smith.”

Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he
tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After
you, Harry.”

Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents
of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark
nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old
lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that
flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was
looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already
scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest houseelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d come at
four, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!”
She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The
top of the elf’s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah’s chair, and her
papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore
draped like a toga.

“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various
angles of her face in the mirror.
“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey.

Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she
must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah
Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.
A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.

“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out
of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see
how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at
least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes,
cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and
many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked
like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.

The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man
Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was
plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at
school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked
more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room
with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low
over Hepzibah’s fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.

“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from
nowhere.
“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old Hepzibah, though
Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little
table. “You do spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit down, sit down. . . . Where’s
Hokey? Ah . . .”

The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of
little cakes, which she set at her mistress’s elbow.
“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you love my cakes.
Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I’ve
said it a hundred times. . . .”
Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked, batting her
lashes.

“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made
armor,” said Voldemort. “Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than
fair —”
“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here for my trinkets!”
pouted Hepzibah.
“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort quietly. “I am only
a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to
inquire —”

“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. “I’ve
something to show you that I’ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a
secret, Tom? Will you promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke I’ve got it? He’d
never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and I’m not selling, not to
Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not
how many Galleons you can get for it.”

“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” said Voldemort
quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.
“I had Hokey bring it out for me. . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to
show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. . . . In fact, bring both, while you’re at
it. . . .”

“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather
boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own
volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she
wended her way between tables, pouffes, and footstools.

“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them
in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, “I think you’ll like this,
Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can’t wait to
get their hands on this!”

She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and
saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good
look!” whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered
hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings.
Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression
was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were
fixed upon Voldemort’s handsome features.

“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the
cup. “Then this was . . . ?”

“Helga Hufflepuff’s, as you very well know, you clever boy!” said
Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually
pinching his hollow cheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was distantly descended?
This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn’t
it? And all sorts of powers it’s supposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested
them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .”
She hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long forefinger and restored it
gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to
notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort’s face as the cup was taken away.
“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? Oh yes, there you
are — take that away now, Hokey.”

The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention
to the much flatter box in her lap.
“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she whispered. “Lean in a
little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I’ve got this
one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he’d love to get it back when I’m
gone. . . .”

She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon
the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it
up to the light, staring at it.
“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate,
serpentine S.

“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of
Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. “I had to pay an arm and a leg
for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for
my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman
who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value —”
There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes flashed scarlet at
the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain.
“— I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn’t
it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice
and safe. . . .”

She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought
Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his
fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!”
She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her
foolish smile falter.

“Are you all right, dear?”
“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well. . . .”
“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose —” said Hepzibah,
looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary
red gleam in Voldemort’s eyes. “Here, Hokey, take these away and lock
them up again. . . . The usual enchantments . . .”
“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and as the little elf
bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again
above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to
Dumbledore’s office.

“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said Dumbledore,
resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. “Hokey the
house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening
cocoa by accident.”

“No way!” said Harry angrily.
“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. “Certainly, there are many
similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases,
somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having
caused the death —”

“Hokey confessed?”
“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned
out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison,” said Dumbledore.
“It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and
confused —”

“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!”
“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. “And, just as with
Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey —”
“— because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had rarely felt more in
sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.
“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she admitted to having
tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire
further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to
extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of course,
proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and
the locket.

“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family had realized that
two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure
of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her
collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the
cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin
and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and
charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had
no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his
disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle
for a very long time.

“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause
once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort
had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the
Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen,
he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies
that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the
other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s
ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and locket.”
“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad.  .  .  . Risking everything,
throwing away his job, just for those . . .”

“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “I hope
you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him,
Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the
locket, at least, as rightfully his.”

“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the cup as well?”
“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said Dumbledore.
“I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not
resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I
think. . . . I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.
“And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until
you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn’s memory for us. Ten years
separate Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only
guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .”

Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory
into the Pensieve.
“Whose memory is it?” he asked.

“Mine,” said Dumbledore.
And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass,
landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering
happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who
looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both
hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less
lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was
that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window
in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.

The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure
enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he
said, “Enter.”

Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His
features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone
cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were
not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer
handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and
blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes
now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits
that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak,
and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently
this visit had been made by appointment.

“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t you sit down?”
“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore
had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated
in the present. “I heard that you had become headmaster,” he said, and his
voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. “A worthy choice.”
“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “May I offer you a
drink?”

“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have come a long way.”
Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the
Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a
goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind
his desk.

“So, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I am known
as —”

“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly.
“But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the
irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”

He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal
to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell
that Voldemort took it as such.

“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never
wished to leave school.”

“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there
can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone
young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of
teaching too.”

“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are
so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been
offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the
Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in
common, I think.”

Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine.
Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but
waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.
“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, perhaps, than
Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request
again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to
ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must
know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show
and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.”
Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a
while before speaking.

“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since
leaving us,” he said quietly. “Rumors of your doings have reached your old
school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.”
Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness
inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this,
Dumbledore.”

“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked
Dumbledore delicately.

“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. “I have
experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than
they have ever been pushed —”

“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “Of some.
Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.”
For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more
threatening than a look of rage.

“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world
has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than
my kind of magic, Dumbledore.”
“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested
Dumbledore.

“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at
Hogwarts?” said Voldemort. “Will you let me return? Will you let me share
my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your
disposal. I am yours to command.”

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will become of those whom
you command? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so
rumor has it — the Death Eaters?”
Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know
this name; he saw Voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils
flare.

“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will carry on without me,
I am sure.”

“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said Dumbledore. “I
was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.”
“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.
“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find a group
of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return?
Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely
to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.”
There could be no doubt that Dumbledore’s detailed knowledge of those
with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort;
however, he rallied almost at once.

“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.”
“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said Dumbledore lightly.
“Now, Tom . . .”

Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat,
the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.
“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by
henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?”
Voldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not want? On the
contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.”

“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach
any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you’re
after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?”
Voldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a job —”
“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t think for a moment
you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must
have had a purpose.”

Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his
features thick with rage. “This is your final word?”
“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing.
“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.”
“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. “The
time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and
force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I
wish I could. . . .”

For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He
was sure that Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his
wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the
door was closing, and he was gone.

Harry felt Dumbledore’s hand close over his arm again and moments
later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no
snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore’s hand was blackened
and dead-looking once more.
“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face. “Why
did he come back? Did you ever find out?”
“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”
“What ideas, sir?”

“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from
Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. “When you have that last piece of
the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.”
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had
walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at
once.

“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t
say. . . .”
“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said
Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we
have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for
longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”


CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE

THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM

arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the
nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did
increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping
that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he
had done so many times before.

“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday
evening.
“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron
wouldn’t be sitting here now.”

“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said
Hermione dismissively.

Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectumsempra!”)
scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was
itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead,
he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.

They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other
people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of
excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign
on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those
who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of
April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which
would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.

Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to
Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had
now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who
would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test
whether ready or not.

“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. “You’ll have no
trouble come July!”

“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to
disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was
now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and
Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low
marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to
tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most
important thing to him now.

“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is
illegal —”

“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a
spell. . . .”

“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can
get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade
Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him a
potion, anyone could do that —”

“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very hard
while staring at his parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”
“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her. “And
‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G either. What kind of quill are you
using?”

“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think the charm
must be wearing off. . . .”
“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, “because
we were asked how we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t
remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.”
“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. “Don’t say I’ll
have to write the whole thing out again!”

“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her
and taking out her wand.
“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his
eyes wearily.
Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear
you saying that.”
“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will . . . then she’ll ditch
me . . .”
“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.
“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho
just —”

“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.
“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily,
watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the
end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. “But the
more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like going out
with the giant squid.”
“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s
essay.

“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”

Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching
out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.

Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly
completed essay, and Harry said, “Kreacher!”
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.
“Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing,
so Kreacher has come to give —”
Crack.

Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew.
“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting
Kreacher a resentful look. “And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is
coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!”
“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden
appearances. “What’s going on, Harry?”

Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione
about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always
such a touchy subject with her.
“Well . . . they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said.
“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher.
“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby proudly,
swaying where he stood.
Hermione looked indignant.

“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him not to
—”
“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, you can sleep, all
right? But has either of you found out anything?” he hastened to ask, before
Hermione could intervene again.
“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,”
croaked Kreacher at once. “His features recall the fine bones of my mistress
and his manners are those of —”

“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. “A bad boy who
— who —”
He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and
then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was
not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast.
For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.
“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it difficult to
speak ill of his old masters. . . .”

Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to
Kreacher, “But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good
master to a house-elf!”

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,”
Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy
eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends
his classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”

“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him
while he enters —”

“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him.
“That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s doing  .  .  .
whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the
map — come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on
there!”

“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you
need it to be Unplottable, it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.

“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters
there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.”
“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy
already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that
stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the
headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room
becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to
transform into.”

“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve done
brilliantly, Dobby.”
“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from looking
grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the
ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he
cannot hear —”

“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep
bow and Disapparated. “You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.”
“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and he too
vanished.

“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and
Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. “We know where
Malfoy’s going! We’ve got him cornered now!”

“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the
sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay.
Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her
wand.

“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of
students’?” said Hermione. “How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t
think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing  .  .  . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”

Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was
a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any
time during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.

“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn
showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of
students standing guard for Malfoy  .  .  . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as
usual. . . . Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in
front of the fire. “They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he
won’t tell them what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen
lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking
Polyjuice to make them look like other people. . . . Those two girls I saw
him with when he missed Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”
“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that that little
girl whose scales I repaired — ?”

“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. “Of course! Malfoy
must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what am I talking
about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because
there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the
toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing
it!”

“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed Ron.
“Blimey  .  .  . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days.  .  .  . I’m
surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . .”
“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?”
said Harry.

“Hmmm  .  .  . the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione
skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to any more
harm and handing it to him.
“We’ll see,” said Harry confidently.

“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. “But,
Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into
the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there first. And I don’t
think you should forget” — she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave
him a very serious look — “that what you’re supposed to be concentrating
on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.”
Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the
girls’ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.
“What d’you think?”

“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at the spot
where Dobby had vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test in the bag.”
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours,
wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he,
Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever
Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the
headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy’s . . . what could
it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A workshop? Harry’s
mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were
broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who
turned into Snape. . . .

Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following
morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and
was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement.
Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered
plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he
thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.

“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily
Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from
opening it and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but
I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain
wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?”

“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said Hermione.
“It’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could
have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of
Requirement” — she jerked the Prophet out from under Harry’s hand and
unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go and find Slughorn
and start appealing to his better nature.”

“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.
“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their
breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been
arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an
Inferius during an attempted burglary  .  .  . and someone called Octavius
Pepper has vanished.  .  .  . Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has
been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the
Imperius Curse. . . .”

They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for
Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his
conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for the corridor on the
seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the
Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.

Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty
passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he
found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside
the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first
attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or
Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.

He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of
Requirement’s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had
become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might
he thought, I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see what
Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . .
Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with
excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it —”

But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall.
He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained
solid and unyielding.
“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay . . . I thought the wrong thing. . . .”
He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating
as hard as he could.

I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . I need to
see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . .
After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.
There was no door.
“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was a clear
instruction. . . . Fine . . .”
He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more.
I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy. . . .
He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his
patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into
existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds
outside. He opened his eyes.

There was still no door.
Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of
first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression
that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.
Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing
inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he
was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room
simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for
Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and
stuffing it into his bag as he went.

“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit
classroom. “Ten points from Gryffindor.”
Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half
the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things;
he could not be much later than any of them.

“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his
wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air
and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your sakes they are
better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if
you will all open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?”
“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference
between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper
about an Inferius —”

“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice.
“But sir, I heard people talking —”

“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would
have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief
by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”

“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered
Harry to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been
arrest —”

“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape,
pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry.
“Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and
a ghost.”

The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what
Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
“Er — well — ghosts are transparent —” he said.
“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. “Yes, it is easy to see
that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you,
Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent.’”

Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were
smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides
were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies,
aren’t they? So they’d be solid —”

“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered Snape. “The
Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is
not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s bidding. A
ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed
soul left upon the earth  .  .  . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us,
transparent.”

“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them
apart!” said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley,
we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not
going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’”
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave
the class.

“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect
nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he
cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.”
“No!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his
mouth furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again,
leave it!”

“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape,
smirking a little, “and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.
. . .”

Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the
end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione
mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly
for his jibe about Ron’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron,
and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with
Harry.

“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after staring into a cracked
mirror for a minute or two. “I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I
just can’t get the hang of Apparition.”

“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see
where they get you,” said Harry reasonably. “It’ll be more interesting than
trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you’re still not — you
know — as good as you’d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with
me over the summ — Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!”
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and
was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round
glasses.

“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.”
“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. “He said
he’d come back and see me, but then you said you’d pop in and visit me
too” — she gave Harry a reproachful look — “and I haven’t seen you for
months and months. I’ve learned not to expect too much from boys.”
“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said Harry, who had been
careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.
“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that doesn’t mean I can’t
visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?”
“Vividly,” said Harry.

“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “Maybe if you two left,
he’d come back again. . . . We had lots in common. . . . I’m sure he felt it.
. . .”

And she looked hopefully toward the door.
“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, sounding rather
amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?”
“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled
bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely
and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his feelings
and cry!”

“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously. “A young
boy?”

“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who
was now definitely grinning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I’ll
take his secret to the —”
“— not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The sewers, maybe
. . .”

Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water
to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have
put fresh heart into Ron.

“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder,
“I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the
test.”

And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the
sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight.
Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village;
he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one
of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had
decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of
Requirement.

“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and
her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get
that memory from him.”

“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had
lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner
Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry
had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and
knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure
he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been trying to
get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it happen!”
“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”

The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his
usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and
Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished
Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase
again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the
Room of Requirement.

Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map
and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he
tapped the map, murmured, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,”
and scanned it carefully.

As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their
various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in
another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement
near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the
library or up a corridor. . . . There were a few people out in the grounds . . .

and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There
was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about
that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the
map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing
down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to
creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy
brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He
waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and
whispering, “Hello . . . you’re very pretty, aren’t you?”

Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the
air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the
scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry
turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco
Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out
there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable
feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet
tried.

Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried
many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall
was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy
might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of
evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely,
Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.

“OUCH!”
He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on
one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
“Harry?”

He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter
astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently
strolled up this corridor.

“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did
she always have to find him lying on the floor?
“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks.

Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored
hair lank.
“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other side of the castle,
behind the gargoyle —”

“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away again.”
“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor.
“Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose?”
“No,” said Tonks.

“What did you want to see him about?”
“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at
the sleeve of her robe. “I just thought he might know what’s going on. . . .
I’ve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . . .”
“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. “That little kid
trying to kill his —”

“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t seem to
be listening to him. “You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order
recently?”

“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry, “not since
Sirius —”
He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean  .  .  . I miss him, as well.
. . .”

“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. “Well . . .
I’ll see you around, Harry . . .”

And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving
Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility
Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of
Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his
stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for
lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who,
hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.
He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through
an early lunch.

“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he
caught sight of him. “I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft’s,
but at least I moved!”

“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”
“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could
answer. “Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the
hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and
you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he
doesn’t pop the question soon —”

“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. “Have you been
up at the Room of Requirement all this time?”

“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!”
“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. . . .”

“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his
conversation with Tonks, “she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after
what happened at the Ministry.”

“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very
concerned. “She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly
abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even
here?”

“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it;
this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she can
have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?”
Hermione stared at him.

“What on earth makes you say that?”
“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying when I
mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. . . .
I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . . you know . . . him.”
“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know why she’d
be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was
here. . . .”

“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling
mashed potato into his mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve.
Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.”
“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d find
a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t
laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus
mimbletonia.”
Ron scowled.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-TWO

AFTER THE BURIAL

atches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle
turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harry’s
mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy
was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that
might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had
apparently suppressed for decades.

“For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,” Hermione told Harry firmly.
They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after
lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet
— Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for they were
taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not
proved soothing to the nerves.

Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around
the corner.
“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily.
“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing.
“Harry Potter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you this.”
“Thanks . . .”

Harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl
was out of earshot he said, “Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any
more lessons until I got the memory!”
“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested Hermione,
as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore’s
long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read
due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had
run.

Dear Harry, Ron, and Hermione,
Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him, and you know
how special he was. Hermione, I know you’d have liked him. It would
mean a lot to me if you’d nip down for the burial later this evening.
I’m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day.
I know you’re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the
cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I can’t face it alone.
Hagrid

“Look at this,” said Harry, handing the note to Hermione.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to
Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous.
“He’s mental!” he said furiously. “That thing told its mates to eat Harry
and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go
down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!”
“It’s not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s asking us to leave the castle at
night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble
we’d be in if we were caught.”

“We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said Harry.
“Yes, but for something like this?” said Hermione. “We’ve risked a lot to
help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of
saving him —”

“— I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly. “You didn’t meet him,
Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.”
Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over
it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . .
“Harry, you can’t be thinking of going,” said Hermione. “It’s such a
pointless thing to get detention for.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury
Aragog without us.”

“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, Potions will be
almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests.  . .  . Try and
soften Slughorn up a bit then!”
“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry bitterly.
“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get lucky!”
“What d’you mean?”

“Use your lucky potion!”
“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding stunned. “Of course!
Why didn’t I think of it?”
Harry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I dunno . . . I was
sort of saving it. . . .”

“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously.
“What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?” asked
Hermione.

Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered
on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated
plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being
happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of
his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time
between sleeping and waking. . . .

“Harry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione.
“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together. “Well . . .
okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and
have another go this evening.”

“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and
performing a graceful pirouette. “Destination  .  .  . determination  .  .  .
deliberation . . .” she murmured.

“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is — quick,
hide me!”

“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls
appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.
“Cool,” said Ron, peering over Hermione’s shoulder to check. “Blimey,
they don’t look happy, do they?”

“They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy,
didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother?” said Hermione.
“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be
honest,” said Ron.

“Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their
mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and
he died in St. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him.”
“He died?” repeated Harry, shocked. “But surely werewolves don’t kill,
they just turn you into one of them?”

“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. “I’ve
heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.”
“What was the werewolf’s name?” said Harry quickly.
“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” said Hermione.
“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me
about!” said Harry angrily.
Hermione looked at him bleakly.

“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s all about stopping
Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to
him. . . .”
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped
to their feet, looking terrified.
“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the
entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test.
“Good luck.”

“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed
off to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie,
and Draco Malfoy.
“All too young to Apparate just yet?” said Slughorn genially. “Not turned
seventeen yet?”
They shook their heads.

“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, we’ll do something
fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!”
“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands
together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile.
“What do you mean, ‘something amusing’?” he said irritably.
“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily.

Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky
expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a
waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of
his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be
spending in the Room of Requirement.

Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner? Certainly
he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so
rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness,
excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the
Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been
given by Voldemort.  .  .  . There could be only one conclusion, in Harry’s
opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.

Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced
Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince’s version
of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which seemed not only to meet
Slughorn’s instructions, but which might (Harry’s heart leapt as the thought
struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared
to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . .

“Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said Slughorn an hour and
a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine
yellow contents of Harry’s cauldron. “Euphoria, I take it? And what’s that I
smell? Mmmm . . . you’ve added just a sprig of peppermint, haven’t you?
Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would
tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and
nose-tweaking. . . . I really don’t know where you get these brain waves,
my boy . . . unless —”

Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince’s book deeper into his bag with his
foot.
“— it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!”
“Oh . . . yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved.
Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once,
he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed
a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was
already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping
Solution merely “passable.”

The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once.
“Sir,” Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder;
when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried
away as fast as he could.
“Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po — ?” called Harry
desperately.

But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the cauldron,
packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to
the common room.

Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.
“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole.
“Harry, I passed!”

“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?”
“He — he just failed,” whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into
the room looking most morose. “It was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the
examiner just spotted that he’d left half an eyebrow behind. . . . How did it
go with Slughorn?”

“No joy,” said Harry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, mate, but you’ll
pass next time — we can take it together.”
“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily. “But half an eyebrow! Like that
matters!”

“I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem really harsh. . . .”
They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition
examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set
off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of
Slughorn and the memory.

“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” Ron
demanded.
“Yeah, I s’pose I’d better,” said Harry. “I don’t reckon I’ll need all of it,
not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take all night. . . . I’ll just take a mouthful.
Two or three hours should do it.”
“It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron reminiscently. “Like you
can’t do anything wrong.”

“What are you talking about?” said Hermione, laughing. “You’ve never
taken any!”
“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as though explaining the
obvious. “Same difference really . . .”

As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that
he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common
room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn’s office once the
teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level
of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come,
and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the
common room, sneaked up to the boys’ dormitory.

Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and
extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
“Well, here goes,” said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and took a
carefully measured gulp.

“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione.
Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an
exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as
though he could have done anything, anything at all  .  .  . and getting the
memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively
easy. . . .

He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right  .  .  . I’m going down to
Hagrid’s.”

“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.
“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?” said
Hermione.

“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a good
feeling about going to Hagrid’s.”
“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked Ron,
looking stunned.

“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. “I feel
like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?”
“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed
now.

“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione anxiously, holding up
the bottle to the light. “You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t
know —”

“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry swung his Cloak over his
shoulders.
Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.
“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing  .  .  . or at least” — he
strolled confidently to the door — “Felix does.”

He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs,
Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs,
Harry slid through the open door.

“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked Lavender Brown,
staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from
the boys’ dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted
across the room away from them.

Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny
and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he
did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny.

“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding annoyed. “You’re
always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. . . .”
The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard
Dean make an angry retort.  .  .  . His feeling of elation increasing, Harry
strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met
nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: This
evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.

Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do, he had no
idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at
a time: He could not see the final destination, he could not see where
Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that
memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten
to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the
smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps
into the dusk.

It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very
pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid’s. It
was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a
whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward
the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to
find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry
lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and
listening to their conversation.

“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” Slughorn was saying
courteously, “most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if
picked at twilight.”
“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. “That enough for
you?”

“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful
of leafy plants. “This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third
years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them.  .  .  . Well, good
evening to you, and many thanks again!”
Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction
of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry
stood, invisible.

Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the
Cloak with a flourish.
“Good evening, Professor.”

“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said Slughorn, stopping
dead in his tracks and looking wary. “How did you get out of the castle?”
“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” said Harry cheerfully,
and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl.

“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter than proper
security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out here, Harry?”
“Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do
just now was to tell the truth. “He’s pretty upset.  .  .  . But you won’t tell
anyone, Professor? I don’t want trouble for him. . . .”

Slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I can’t promise that,”
he said gruffly. “But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so
I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. . . .”
“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years.  .  .  . It lived in the
forest. . . . It could talk and everything —”

“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said Slughorn
softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. “It’s true, then?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it
died last night. He’s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I
said I’d go.”

“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy
eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid’s cabin. “But acromantula
venom is very valuable . . . If the beast only just died it might not yet have
dried out.  .  .  . Of course, I wouldn’t want to do anything insensitive if
Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some . . . I mean, it’s
almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it’s alive. . . .”

Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now.
“.  .  . seems an awful waste not to collect it  .  .  . might get a hundred
Galleons a pint. . . . To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .”

And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.
“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted
to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased.  .  .  . Give
Aragog a better send-off, you know . . .”
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm.

“I tell you what, Harry, I’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . .
We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not health — but we’ll send it off in
style, anyway, once it’s buried. And I’ll change my tie, this one is a little
exuberant for the occasion. . . .”

He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid’s, delighted
with himself.
“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry
emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Harry. “They’re
really sorry.”

“Don’ — don’ matter  .  .  . He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here, though,
Harry. . . .”
Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of
what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red,
and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the
highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.

“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?”

“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of
his shirt. “The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now
Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can
yeh believe that, Harry?”

The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene
when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had
been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from
eating Hagrid.

“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid,
shaking his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can
tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a
nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . .”

He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow,
saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right
thing to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.”

“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh
shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and
pay his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”

“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before.  .  .  . Comin’ ter see old
Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”

Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled
and tangled.

“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?”
“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a choked
voice. “I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a
few nice things over him — happy memories, yeh know —”

His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he
turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as
he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms,
and wearing a somber black cravat.

“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sorry to hear of your
loss.”

“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not
givin’ Harry detention neither. . . .”

“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad night . . .
Where is the poor creature?”

“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we — shall we do it,
then?”

The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was
glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the
edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.

“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to
Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I
didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.”

“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping
back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his
cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing.
“Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial?”

Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into
his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the
bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn,
who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all
the same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”

He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry
thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of
the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of
arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t
forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet,
web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants
ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have
sustained.”

“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed
onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.

“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of
earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead
spider, forming a smooth mound. “Let’s get inside and have a drink. Get on
his other side, Harry. . . . That’s it. . . . Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done
. . .”

They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been
skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to
them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked
one of the bottles of wine he had brought.

“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, pouring most of
the first bottle into one of Hagrid’s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to
Hagrid. “Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your
poor friend Rupert.”

Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on Hermione’s face if she
ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it
to her.

“One for Harry . . .” said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two
mugs, “.  .  . and one for me. Well” — he raised his mug high — “to
Aragog.”

“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way
ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so
he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table
before him.

“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little
thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.”
“Sweet,” said Slughorn.

“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well . . .”
Hagrid’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived
to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of
Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up
at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long,
silky skein of bright white hair.

“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out of their tails, they
catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .”
“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?”

“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets injured,” said
Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s dead useful . . . very strong, see.”
Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving
carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures
that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak-matured
mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled
Hagrid’s mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that
lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them
all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and
Slughorn’s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily
into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.

The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed
that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast.
Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying
the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight
was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either
Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs)
he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they
immediately began to refill.

After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant
toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to —
“Harry Potter!” bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket
of wine down his chin as he drained it.

“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry Otter, the Chosen
Boy Who — well — something of that sort,” he mumbled, and drained his
mug too.

Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole
unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, “To friendship!
To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!”

And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side,
arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard
called Odo.

“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the
table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain.
“Me dad was no age ter go . . . nor were yer mum an’ dad, Harry . . .”
Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid’s crinkled eyes again;
he grasped Harry’s arm and shook it.

“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age I never knew . . . terrible thing . . .
terrible thing . . .”
And Odo the hero, they bore him back home
To the place that he’d known as a lad,
sang Slughorn plaintively.

They laid him to rest with his hat inside out
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.
“. . . terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways
onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply.
“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a tune to save my
life.”

“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly. “He was
talking about my mum and dad dying.”
“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh dear. Yes, that was —
was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible . . .”
He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their
mugs.

“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he asked awkwardly.
“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his eyes on the
flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores. “But I’ve found out
pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?”
“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice.
“Yeah  .  .  . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body
toward my mum,” said Harry.

Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his
horrified gaze away from Harry’s face.
“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry remorselessly. “He told
me she needn’t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.”
“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have . . . she needn’t . . . That’s
awful. . . .”

“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. “But
she didn’t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too.
She tried to plead with Voldemort . . . but he just laughed. . . .”
“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand.
“Really, my dear boy, enough  .  .  . I’m an old man  .  .  . I don’t need to
hear . . . I don’t want to hear . . .”
“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. “You liked her, didn’t
you?”

“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. “I
don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her.  .  .  . Very
brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible thing. . . .”
“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave me her life, but you
won’t give me a memory.”

Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into
Slughorn’s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.
“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question . . . If it were to help
you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .”
“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs information. I need
information.”

He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would
remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the
eye, Harry leaned forward a little.
“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.”
Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.
“You are the Chosen One?”
“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly.

“But then  .  .  . my dear boy  .  .  . you’re asking a great deal  .  .  . you’re
asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy —”
“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?”
“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but —”

“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?”
Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.

“Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . .”
Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his
mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.
“I am not proud . . .” he whispered through his fingers. “I am ashamed of
what — of what that memory shows.  .  .  . I think I may have done great
damage that day. . . .”

“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,” said
Harry. “It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.”
Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at
each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but
Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait.

Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his
wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty
bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand
to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came
away too, clinging to the wand-tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched
until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it
into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the
bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.
“Thank you very much, Professor.”

“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat
cheeks into his walrus mustache. “And you’ve got her eyes. . . . Just don’t
think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. . . .”
And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE

HORCRUXES

arry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the
castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the
third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving
sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait
of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to
find her in a most unhelpful mood.

“What sort of time do you call this?”
“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important —”
“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to sleep in
the corridor, won’t you?”

“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to change at midnight?”
“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re angry, go and take it
up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened security.”
“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. “Really
brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here,
because he’s the one who wanted me to —”

“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor Dumbledore returned
to the school an hour ago.”

Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as
usual upon his ruff.
“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” said Nick. “He
appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired,
of course.”

“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping.
“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a favorite
pastime of his —”
“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!”

“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what the Baron said,
that he had business to attend to before turning in —”
“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect
of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and
sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.
“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The
password’s still ‘tapeworm’!”

But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within
minutes, he was saying “toffee éclairs” to Dumbledore’s gargoyle, which
leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase.
“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted.
Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore’s office, looking the
same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows.
“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. “To what do I owe
this very late pleasure?”

“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.”
Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a
moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a
wide smile.

“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you
could do it!”
All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried
around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn’s memory in his uninjured
hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve.
“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and
emptying the contents of the bottle into it. “Now, at last, we shall see.
Harry, quickly . . .”

Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the
office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace
Slughorn’s office many years before.

There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, strawcolored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the
comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet
pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of
crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting
around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo’s goldand-black ring gleaming on his finger.
Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, “Sir, is it true that
Professor Merrythought is retiring?”

“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his
finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. “I must say,
I’d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.”

Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your
careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by
the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”
Several of the boys tittered again.

“— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty
years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts
at the Ministry.”

Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that
he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed
to look to him as their leader.

“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said when the laughter
had died away. “I don’t have the right kind of background, for one thing.”
A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure
they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or
suspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous ancestor.
“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be plainer you come from
decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve
never been wrong about a student yet.”

The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven
o’clock behind him and he looked around.
“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better get going, boys, or
we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s
detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”

One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out
of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement
behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there.
“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours,
and you a prefect . . .”

“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the
stem of his wine glass.

“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?”
But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not
schoolwork.

“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term while reading and
I didn’t fully understand it.”
“No . . . well . . . you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that’ll
give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark
indeed,” said Slughorn.

“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you
— sorry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone
could tell me, you could — so I just thought I’d ask —”
It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the
careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much
experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to
recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the
information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this
moment for weeks.

“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon
on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an
overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the
word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.”
“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, sir,” said Riddle.

His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.
“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in
an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or
destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and
undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .”

Slughorn’s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words
he had heard nearly two years before: “I was ripped from my body, I was
less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.”
“. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.”
But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he
could no longer hide his longing.

“How do you split your soul?”
“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand that the soul
is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it
is against nature.”
“But how do you do it?”

“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”

“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking
his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though
I have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I didn’t mean
to offend . . .”

“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s natural to
feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have
always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .”

“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of
curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split
your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul
in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully
magical number, wouldn’t seven — ?”

“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t it bad enough to
think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the
soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .”

Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though
he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was
regretting entering into the conversation at all.
“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re discussing,
isn’t it? All academic . . .”

“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly.
“But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I’ve told — that’s to say,
what we’ve discussed. People wouldn’t like to think we’ve been chatting
about Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know.  .  .  .
Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. . . .”

“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry
had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had
worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness
that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less
human. . . .

“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us go. . . .”
When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already
sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to
speak.

“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,” said
Dumbledore at last. “It confirms the theory on which I have been working,
it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .”
Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and
headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in
on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out
an ear trumpet.

“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you understood the
significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or
take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to
make himself immortal.”

“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He made a Horcrux?
And that’s why he didn’t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux
hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?”

“A bit . . . or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard Voldemort: What he
particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to
the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the
wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder
many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately
concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As
far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever
done more than tear his soul in two.”

Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then
said, “Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that
Voldemort had split his soul.”
“Where?” asked Harry. “How?”

“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary, Riddle’s
diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of
Secrets.”

“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what
you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere
memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the
life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much
more sinister had lived inside that book . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost
sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions
as it answered.

“What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been
intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.”
“I still don’t understand,” said Harry.

“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the
fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly
played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no
doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul
to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be
unleashed again.”

“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” said Harry. “He
wanted people to know he was Slytherin’s heir, because he couldn’t take
credit at the time.”

“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t you see, Harry,
that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future
Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blasé about that precious
fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as
Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not
to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy
it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you
saw to that.

“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed
most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been
planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not
be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to
make sense.

“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort
returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to
his Death Eaters. ‘I, who have gone further than anybody along the path
that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said. ‘Further than
anybody.’ And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters
did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry,
which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord
Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the
transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his
soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’
. . .”

“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?”
said Harry. “Why couldn’t he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he
was so interested in immortality?”
“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” said
Dumbledore. “But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer’s Stone
would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.

“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk
regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality.
Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it
ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just
like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe
that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the
Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him
out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you,
but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to
continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he
could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see  .  .  . or as
close to immortal as any man can be.

“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you
have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing
Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry:
‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more
pieces . . . isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number . . . ’ Isn’t seven
the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part
soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.”

“He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while several of
the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. “But
they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —”
“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said
Dumbledore calmly. “But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The
seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated
body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many
years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece
of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack
— the piece that lives in his body.”

“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little desperately, “how are
we supposed to find them?”
“You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I
have destroyed another.”
“You have?” said Harry eagerly.

“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burnedlooking hand. “The ring, Harry. Marvolo’s ring. And a terrible curse there
was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty
— for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape’s timely action
when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to
tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable
exchange for a seventh of Voldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a
Horcrux.”

“But how did you find it?”
“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to
discover as much as I can about Voldemort’s past life. I have traveled
widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring
hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems that once Voldemort had
succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it
anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack
where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to
Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to
visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical
concealment.

“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You
destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a
seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.”

“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They could be old tin cans
or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .”
“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects,
easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion
bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have
showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred
objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own
superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in
magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have
chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the
honor.”

“The diary wasn’t that special.”
“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of
Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous
importance.”

“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what
they are, sir?”

“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have already
given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in
themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through
Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have
disappeared around him.”

“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects
owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders
would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s
imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything
of Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of
Gryffindor remains safe.”

Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where
a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case.
“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts,
sir?” said Harry. “To try and find something from one of the other
founders?”

“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But unfortunately, that does
not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe,
without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he
never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. He
definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do
for now.”

“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves
a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, counting on his fingers. “Unless he got both?”
“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know what the sixth
Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been
curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?”

“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use animals as Horcruxes?”
“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to confide a
part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is
obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct,
Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he
entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you.

“He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for
particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He
believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had
outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he
was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death.

“As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he
used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to
him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin
connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mystique; I think he is
perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep
her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even
for a Parselmouth.”

“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket,
and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that
was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?”
“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” said Dumbledore,
bowing his head.

“So  .  .  . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been
going when you’ve been leaving the school?”
“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a very long time. I
think  .  .  . perhaps  .  .  . I may be close to finding another one. There are
hopeful signs.”
“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with you and help get
rid of it?”

Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying,
“Yes, I think so.”
“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think you have earned
that right.”

Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and
protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls
seemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s decision; Harry saw a few of them
shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.
“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel
it?” Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.

“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that
Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself
have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the
point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for
instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of
Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been
mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible
to behold.”

“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?”
“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create
more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort’s sayso, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving
him the diary.

“No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the
Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon
Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius
believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I
understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber
of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known
he held a portion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly
have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and
carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur
Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly
incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with
Voldemort’s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own
gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he
is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”

Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes
are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort
will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget,
though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his
magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill
a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”
“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he
could stop himself.

“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a power that
Voldemort has never had. You can —”

“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with
difficulty that he stopped himself adding, “Big deal!”
“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as though he
knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. “Which,
given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing.
You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.”
“So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the Dark Lord knows
not,’ it just means — love?” asked Harry, feeling a little let down.

“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget that what
the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told
you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who
would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the
person who would be most dangerous to him!”
“But it comes to the same —”

“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at
Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, “You are setting too much
store by the prophecy!”

“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means —”
“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been
fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every
prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”
“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said one of us would
have to kill the other —”

“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on
Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father,
would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not!
If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a
magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you
see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere
do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All
of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be
one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!
Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He
heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only
handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely
deadly weapons!”

“But —”
“It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore, standing up
and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake;
Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting to kill you,
Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front
of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you
were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand
the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite
your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift
any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the
Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become
one of Voldemort’s followers!”

“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He killed my mum and
dad!”
“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore
loudly. “The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of
power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all
the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age
of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire,
and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not
immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could
have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then
what he was dealing with, but he did not!

“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind
without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring
mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he
understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his
own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul
that is untarnished and whole.”

“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative,
“it all comes to the same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try and kill him, or
—”

“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! But not because of
the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried! We
both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard
that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and
thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of
Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord
Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his
throat.

“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d want to do it.”
“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does
not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord
Voldemort to mark you as his equal.  .  .  . In other words, you are free to
choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But
Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt
you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —”

“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. “Yes.”
But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It
was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face
a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high.
Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the
two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush
of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in
the world.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-FOUR

SECTUMSEMPRA

xhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry told Ron and
Hermione everything that had happened during next morning’s
Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest
them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled
the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about
Voldemort’s Horcruxes and Dumbledore’s promise to take Harry along,
should he find another one.

“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them
everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the
ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing.
“Wow. You’re actually going to go with Dumbledore  .  .  . and try and
destroy . . . wow.”

“Ron, you’re making it snow,” said Hermione patiently, grabbing his
wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure
enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry
noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes,
and Hermione immediately let go of Ron’s arm.

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise.
“Sorry . . . looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now. . . .”
He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione’s shoulder. Lavender
burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.
“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. “Last night.
When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously
she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.”
“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”

“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least
I didn’t have to finish it.”

“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a
bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.”
Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him
that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly
dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as
indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?”

“Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her
through the portrait hole, like she couldn’t climb in herself . . . but they’ve
been a bit rocky for ages.”

Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He
certainly looked unhappy.
“Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said
Hermione.

“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“The Quidditch team,” said Hermione. “If Ginny and Dean aren’t
speaking . . .”
“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry.

“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was
bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had
managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson
liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and Ron’s were still murky brown.
“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. “A little
less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .”

Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and
pointed them at their flasks. Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask
exploded.

“Yes . . . for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under
the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, “practice.”
They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked
back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively
lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione
seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she
simply said, “It’s a nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a
fierce battle was raging inside Harry’s brain:

She’s Ron’s sister.
But she’s ditched Dean!
She’s still Ron’s sister.
I’m his best mate!
That’ll make it worse.
If I talked to him first —
He’d hit you.
What if I don’t care?
He’s your best mate!

Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole
into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group
of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, “Katie!
You’re back! Are you okay?”

Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and
surrounded by her jubilant friends.

“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of St. Mungo’s on
Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came
back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and
the last match, Harry. . . .”

“Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a
decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the
running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .”

He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny
temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katie’s friends started
gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.
“. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?”
“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. “Everyone’s been asking me,
but I haven’t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the
ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.”

“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said Hermione.
“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so I suppose
whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my
memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen, I’d
better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my
first day back. . . .”

She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving
Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what
she had told them.

“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,”
said Hermione, “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.”

“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t
forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know
some of it got stolen. . . .”

In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance
past, all transformed into girls.

“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a
go at the Room of Requirement again.”

“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly,
putting down the copy of Spellman’s Syllabary she had just taken out of her
bag. “Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with
him . . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.

“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.

“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the
list of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew.
. . .”

“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner
of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell,
captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks previously. He
had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it
around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next
time he came up behind him unawares.

The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back
at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill
her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told
him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he
walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his
back.

The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had
known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad
to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.

Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the
contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron
anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goalposts as the Quaffle
sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being
knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the
others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had
received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not
been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.

The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he
thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked
Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron’s expression when he had seen her
kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if
Harry so much as held her hand. . . .

Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her,
walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached,
he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have
been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would
not be around — but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them
up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione’s help, but he did
not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he
caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or
laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry
that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He
and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her
own good.

All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was
becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione
put it, “tweaking the circumstances”? The balmy days slid gently through
May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoulder every time he saw
Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would
somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than
his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone
together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either
while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to
talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.

Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw
game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match
would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor
beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet
Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the
Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would
come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be
third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would
be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him
forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first
bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.

The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of
rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors;
unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they
passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying
all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up.

Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry’s mind with
success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if
they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a
nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix
Felicis.

In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other
ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement.
He was still checking the Marauder’s Map, and as he was unable to locate
Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within
the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in
getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was
in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall
remained firmly doorless.

A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself
walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed
off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having
dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might
have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything,
Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the
Marauder’s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy
anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement
again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’
bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by
Moaning Myrtle.

Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right
into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying
from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and
along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear
against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the
door open.

Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching
either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.
“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles.
“Don’t . . . tell me what’s wrong . . . I can help you. . . .”
“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. “I
can’t do it. . . . I can’t. . . . It won’t work . . . and unless I do it soon . . . he
says he’ll kill me. . . .”

And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the
spot, that Malfoy was crying — actually crying — tears streaming down his
pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a
great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at
him over his shoulder.

Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled
out his own. Malfoy’s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on
the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus!
and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for
another —

“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly
around the tiled room. “Stop! STOP!”
There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry
attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy’s
ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly;
water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted,
cried, “Cruci —”

“SECTUMSEMPRA!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand
wildly.

Blood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though he had been
slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto
the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp
right hand.

“No —” gasped Harry.
Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward
Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at
his blood-soaked chest.

“No — I didn’t —”
Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside
Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood.
Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: “MURDER! MURDER IN
THE BATHROOM! MURDER!”

The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape
had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he
knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds
Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like
song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from
Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be
knitting.

Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware
that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still
sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse
for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position.
“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring,
but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that. . . . Come.
. . .”

He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a
voice of cold fury, “And you, Potter . . . You wait here for me.”
It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly,
shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating
like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself
to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with
increasingly evident enjoyment.

Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and
closed the door behind him.
“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once,
leaving a ringing silence behind her.

“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the
cold, watery space. “I didn’t know what that spell did.”
But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he
said quietly. “Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who
taught you that spell?”

“I — read about it somewhere.”
“Where?”
“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I can’t remember
what it was call —”
“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was
going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. . . .

The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block
out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of
Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind.
And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked,
soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape’s black eyes, hoping against hope
that Snape had not seen what he feared, but —

“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all of your
schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!”
There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed out of the
bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor
Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him,
drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at
him as he ran past.

He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly
savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his
book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn
— Harry’s stomach churned — how Harry had been achieving such good
results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had
taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and
friend? Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not . . .
“Where’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood?”

Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at the sight
of Harry.
“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. Quick . . . give it
to me . . .”
“But what about the Half-Blood —”
“I’ll explain later!”

Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and
handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room.
Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people
who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait
hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor.
He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes,
and began to walk.

I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I
need a place to hide my book. . . .
Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall.
When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of
Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung himself inside, and slammed it
shut.

He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him
back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was
looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose
high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a
city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden
by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. 

There were alleyways and roads
bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away,
perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castleproud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt
banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged
Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the
mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of
congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon
eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several
rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.

Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this
hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a
short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague
had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that
seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of
the cupboard’s creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place
for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs.

He stuffed the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage and slammed the
door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around
at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this
junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a
nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now
hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to
make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of
hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the
corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back
into stone.

Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming
Ron’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute
later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for
Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his
chest, and waited.

One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them. Finally,
the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully
before speaking.

“This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard.
“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance.
“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from
Flourish and Blotts?”
“Yes,” said Harry firmly.

“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’
written inside the front cover?”
Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” he said.
“Your nickname,” repeated Snape.
“Yeah . . . that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry.
“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The cold, black eyes were
boring once more into Harry’s; he tried not to look into them. Close your
mind.  .  .  . Close your mind.  .  .  . But he had never learned how to do it
properly. . . .

“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very quietly. “I think
that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every
Saturday until the end of term. What do you think, Potter?”
“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape’s
eyes.

“Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said Snape. “Ten
o’clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.”
“But sir . . .” said Harry, looking up desperately. “Quidditch . . . the last
match of the . . .”

“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow
teeth. “Poor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I fear . . .”
And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare
into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt
in his life.

“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’” said Hermione, an hour later in the common
room.
“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily.

Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just
finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that
there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast:

Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every
bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in
the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying
Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had
happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure
fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall,
who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she
supported wholeheartedly Snape’s punishment of detention every Saturday
until the end of term.

“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,”
Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. “And I was right, wasn’t
I?”

“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly.
He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the
looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when he had told them he would not
be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could
feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see
disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be
playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as
Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up
during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an
icy knife. . . .

“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when
that spell —”

“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince
only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we
know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”

“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without
the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how
to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”

“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.

“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so
grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an
Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his
sleeve!”

“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly
stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where
it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to your
chances in the match —”

“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,” snapped
Ginny, “you’ll only embarrass yourself.”

Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on
together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in
opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a
book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, little though he knew he
deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of
them spoke again for the rest of the evening.

His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be
endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who
were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final
match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told
Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the
world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the
others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students
streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and
brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the
dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite
obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of
commentary or a cheer or groan.

“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and
entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors
above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy
dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.
Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where
Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and
pointless work about them.

“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,” said
Snape softly. “They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their
punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered
damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and
punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order,
replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.”
“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put
into the last three syllables.

“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips,
“with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You
will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the
task. Here, you see . . .”

He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and
read, “‘James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex
upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size. Double
detention.’” Snape sneered. “It must be such a comfort to think that, though
they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains. . . .”

Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting
his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes
and pulled one toward him.

It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as
Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant
he had just read his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled together in
various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus
Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various
offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where
the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .
Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It
seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had
bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half
an hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . .

Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past
twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task,
finally looked up at ten past one.
“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place you have reached.
You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday.”
“Yes, sir.”

Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the
door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps,
straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. . . . It was
over, then. . . .

He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble
staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated
or commiserated in their own common room.
“Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he
would find inside.

Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll see.”
And she swung forward.

A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as
people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into
the room.
“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver
Cup at Harry. “We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We
won!”

Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a
hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And
without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that
fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.

After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or
possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very
quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of
nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean
Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as
though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s
eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing
an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a
fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of
the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you must.

The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny
and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds
seemed indicated, during which — if they had time — they might discuss
the match.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-FIVE

THE SEER OVERHEARD

he fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed
to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry
found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few
weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of
something that was making him happier than he could remember being for
a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific
scenes of Dark Magic.

“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said Ginny, as she
sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry’s legs and reading the
Daily Prophet. “Three dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane
does is ask me if it’s true you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your
chest.”

Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.
“What did you tell her?”

“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, turning a page of the
newspaper idly. “Much more macho.”

“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell her Ron’s got?”
“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.”

Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.
“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny. “Just because
I’ve given my permission doesn’t mean I can’t withdraw it —”
“‘Your permission,’” scoffed Ginny. “Since when did you give me
permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you’d rather it was
Harry than Michael or Dean.”

“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as long as you don’t
start snogging each other in public —”
“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around
like a pair of eels all over the place?” demanded Ginny.

But Ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June,
for Harry and Ginny’s time together was becoming increasingly restricted.
Ginny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to study
for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to
the library, and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room,
supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a
particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at
lunchtime, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an
unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.

“I want to talk to you, Harry.”
“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione
had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard
for her examinations.

“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.”
“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?”
He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his
book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though
Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry
being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of
laying hands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it
was while Snape remained on the lookout.

“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out.
Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of
inventing Dark spells —”
“He didn’t make a hobby of it —”
“He, he — who says it’s a he?”
“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, Hermione,
Prince!”

“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a
very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the
table in front of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the picture!”
Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving
photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look too. The picture
showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked
simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face.
Underneath the photograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, CAPTAIN OF THE
HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM.

“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying
to say. He burst out laughing.

“No way.”
“What?”
“You think she was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father
was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle,
then that would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.

“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls
are clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know
the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.
Where did you get this anyway?”
“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of
old Prophets up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince
if I can.”

“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.
“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him,
as she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”
Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation
of the darkening sky.

“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” said Ron,
returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you?”
“’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, the Prince.
Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . .” He drew his finger significantly
across his own throat. “I wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean,
I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great —”
“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly.

“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.”
“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience
squirmed slightly all the same. “Thanks to Snape . . .”
“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” Ron continued.
“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,” sighed
Harry. “And he’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the
end of term, we’ll carry on next year.”

He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut
into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny.
Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this,
for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed
asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied
opportunities it offered.

Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his
side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.
“Thanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said Harry excitedly,
unrolling the parchment and scanning it. “He wants me to go to his office as
quick as I can!”

They stared at each other.
“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon . . . he hasn’t found . . . ?”
“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to his feet.
He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as
he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite
direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and
cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had
vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left
until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.
And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks,
listening.

“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!”
The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted toward it,
his wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner, and saw Professor
Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many
shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.
“Professor —”

Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some
of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccuped
loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on Harry’s helping arm.
“What happened, Professor?”

“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling along, brooding
upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed . . .”
But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they
were standing: There on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls, and on
the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed —
“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?”
“.  .  . omens I have been vouchsafed — what?” She looked suddenly
shifty.

“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were you trying to get in
there?”
“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about —”
“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? You
screamed. . . . It sounded as though you were hurt. . . .”

“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her
defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. “I
wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items in the room.
. . .” And she muttered something about “nasty accusations.”
“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. “But you
couldn’t get in and hide them?”

He found this very odd; the room had opened for him, after all, when he
had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince’s book.
“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall.
“But there was somebody already in there.”
“Somebody in — ? Who?” demanded Harry. “Who was in there?”

“I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback
at the urgency in Harry’s voice. “I walked into the room and I heard a voice,
which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the
room, I mean.”

“A voice? Saying what?”
“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said Professor Trelawney. “It
was . . . whooping.”
“Whooping?”

“Gleefully,” she said, nodding.
Harry stared at her.
“Was it male or female?”
“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor Trelawney.
“And it sounded happy?”

“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily.
“As though it was celebrating?”
“Most definitely.”
“And then — ?”
“And then I called out ‘Who’s there?’”
“You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?” Harry asked
her, slightly frustrated.

“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her
shawls and many strands of glittering beads, “was fixed upon matters well
outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.”

“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney’s
Inner Eye all too often before. “And did the voice say who was there?”
“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch-black and the next
thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!”
“And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable to help himself.
“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch —” She stopped and glared at him
suspiciously.

“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said Harry. “He ought
to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I mean, that someone threw you out of the
room.”

To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion,
looking haughty.

“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from
me,” she said coldly. “I am not one to press my company upon those who
do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards
show —” Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry’s wrist. “Again and
again, no matter how I lay them out —” And she pulled a card dramatically
from underneath her shawls. “— the lightning-struck tower,” she
whispered. “Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time . . .”
“Right,” said Harry again. “Well  .  .  . I still think you should tell
Dumbledore about this voice, and everything going dark and being thrown
out of the room. . . .”

“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a
moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little
adventure.

“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got a meeting with
him. We could go together.”

“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent
down, scooped up her sherry bottles, and dumped them unceremoniously in
a large blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche.
“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said soulfully as they set
off together. “You were never much of a Seer . . . but you were a wonderful
Object . . .”

Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor
Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom.

“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, the centaur —
knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him — one Seer to another — had he
not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he
seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!”

Her voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a powerful whiff of
sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.

“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my
great-great-grandmother’s gift. Those rumors have been bandied about by
the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would
Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me
all these years, had I not proved myself to him?”
Harry mumbled something indistinct.

“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” went on
Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. “He was deeply impressed, of course,
deeply impressed.  .  .  . I was staying at the Hog’s Head, which I do not
advise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy — but funds were low.

Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room. He
questioned me.  .  .  . I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed illdisposed toward Divination . . . and I remember I was starting to feel a little
odd, I had not eaten much that day . . . but then . . .”
And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he
knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy
that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and
Voldemort.

“. . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!”
“What?”

“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there
was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling
about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I’m afraid that I
myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my
interview with Dumbledore — you see, he himself was seeking a job at the
time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know,
Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not
help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast
between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the
pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes —
Harry, dear?”

She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that Harry
was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet
from each other.
“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly.

Perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and
frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over
him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that
had been kept from him for so long. . . .

It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had
carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew
together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son. . . .
Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.
“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I thought we were
going to see the headmaster together?”

“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips.
“But dear . . . I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of
—”
“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily.
She looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the corner into
Dumbledore’s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted
the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three
steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore’s door, he hammered;
and the calm voice answered, “Enter” after Harry had already flung himself
into the room.

Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with
reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows. Dumbledore was
standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling
cloak in his arms.

“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.”
For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with
Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed
to be moving very slowly.
“Come . . . with you . . . ?”
“Only if you wish it, of course.”
“If I . . .”

And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to
Dumbledore’s office in the first place. “You’ve found one? You’ve found a
Horcrux?”
“I believe so.”
Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: For several moments,
Harry could not speak.

“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was
one emotion he was not feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?”
“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake —
but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a
cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which
Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their
annual trip; you remember?”

“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?”
“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.”
Dumbledore hesitated, then said, “Harry, I promised you that you could
come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of
me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.”

“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished
speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate
and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to
show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window and
looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.

“What has happened to you?”
“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly.
“What has upset you?”
“I’m not upset.”

“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens —”
The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury.
“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind
them. “Snape’s what’s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it
was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!”
Dumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face
whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment,
Dumbledore said nothing. “When did you find out about this?” he asked at
last.

“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous
difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. “AND YOU LET
HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY
MUM AND DAD!”

Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away from
Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the
study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of
restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and
storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy
the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting
Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along
unless he mastered his anger. . . .

“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to me.”
It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting.
Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face.
“Professor Snape made a terrible —”

“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!”
“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly,
then went on. “Professor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in
Lord Voldemort’s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor
Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had
heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know — he
had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from
then onward, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest
were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and
father —”

Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed, Professor,
how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?”

“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized
how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be
the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned —”
“But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said Harry, whose voice
was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. “And isn’t Voldemort
convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor . . . how can you
be sure Snape’s on our side?”

Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was
trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, “I am sure. I
trust Severus Snape completely.”
Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself.
It did not work.

“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to something with
Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still —”
“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, and now he sounded
stern again. “I have told you my views.”

“You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even
considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to —”
“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. “What is it that you
suspect them of doing, precisely?”

“I  .  .  . they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his hands curled into
fists as he said it. “Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of
Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy
whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend something dangerous in there
and if you ask me, he’s fixed it at last and you’re about to just walk out of
school without —”

“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell
silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do
you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences
this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional
protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my
students seriously, Harry.”

“I didn’t —” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across
him.
“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.”
Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had
ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on,
“Do you wish to come with me tonight?”
“Yes,” said Harry at once.

“Very well, then: Listen.” Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height.
“I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might
give you at once, and without question.”
“Of course.”

“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such
orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go back.’ Do I have your word?”
“I — yes, of course.”

“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?”
“Yes.”
“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?”
“Yes.”
“If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?”
“I —”
“Harry?”
They looked at each other for a moment.
“Yes, sir.”

“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and
meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes’ time.”
Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was
now a ruby red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the
office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a
sudden. He knew what to do.

Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he
came back. “What does he want?” Hermione said at once. “Harry, are you
okay?” she added anxiously.

“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs
and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the
Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the
stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and
Hermione sat, looking stunned.

“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore thinks I’m getting my
Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .”

Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not pause
either for Hermione’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they
could work out the finer details for themselves later.

“.  .  . so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop.
“Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have another
clear shot at whatever he’s up to. No, listen to me!” he hissed angrily, as
both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “I know it was
Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here —” He shoved the
Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and
you’ve got to watch Snape too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from
the D.A., Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right?

Dumbledore says he’s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape’s
involved, he’ll know what Dumbledore’s protection is, and how to avoid it
— but he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?”
“Harry —” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.

“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take this as well —”
He thrust the socks into Ron’s hands.
“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?”

“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix Felicis. Share it
between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. I’d better
go, Dumbledore’s waiting —”

“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden
potion, looking awestruck. “We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what
you’re going to be facing?”

“I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I want to know you
lot are okay. . . . Don’t look like that, Hermione, I’ll see you later. . . .”
And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the
entrance hall.

Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as
Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, panting hard, a
searing stitch in his side.

“I would like you to wear your Cloak, please,” said Dumbledore, and he
waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, “Very good. Shall we
go?”

Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own traveling cloak
barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the
Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot.
“But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?”
Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.

“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said Dumbledore lightly. “I
sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head . . . or I
appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination.”
They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air
was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood smoke from
Hagrid’s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for
anything dangerous or frightening.

“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive
came into view, “will we be Apparating?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a license.”

He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a
hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?
“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you again.”

They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade.
Darkness descended fast as they walked, and by the time they reached the
High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows
over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous
shouting.

“— and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard. “Oh, hello, Albus . . . You’re out late . . .”
“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening . . . forgive me, I’m off to the
Hog’s Head. . . . No offense, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight.
. . .”

A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog’s
Head’s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the
Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.

“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered Dumbledore, glancing
around. “As long as nobody sees us go . . . now place your hand upon my
arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On
the count of three . . . One . . . two . . . three . . .”

Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being
squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part
of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then, just when he
thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he
was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-SIX

THE CAVE

arry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze
ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky.
He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and
churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood
behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock,
such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked
as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the
past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree
or sweep of grass or sand.

“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking
Harry’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry, who
could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.

“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a village of sorts about
halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there
for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom
Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could
reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats
cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I
imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than
ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the
pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it,
don’t you?”

Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.
“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. Come.”
Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series
of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay halfsubmerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and
Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The
lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt
spray hitting his face.

“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff
face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of
the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside
him was illuminated too.

“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher.
Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.
“You will not object to getting a little wet?”
“No,” said Harry.

“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now —
and let us take the plunge.”

And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid
from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect
breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his
teeth. Harry pulled off his Cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and
weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang
of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now
moving deeper into the cliff.

The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be
filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart
and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore’s wand. A
little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it
extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore’s wake, the
tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.

Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair
and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that
led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his
soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and
freezing air.

Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high
as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.
“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore.
“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.
“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply.

Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to
his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He
watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently
concentrating on things Harry could not see.

“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dumbledore
after a moment or two. “We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is
Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature
made. . . .”

Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his
blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did
not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching
as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his
fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he
stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.

“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.”
Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard
work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had
long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of
ineptitude than expertise.

Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the
rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as
though there was a powerful light behind the crack.

“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the
words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and
solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.

“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry
and at once, Harry’s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been
hanging in front of a blazing fire.

“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned
his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but
simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely
interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to
break Dumbledore’s concentration. Then, after two solid minutes,
Dumbledore said quietly, “Oh, surely not. So crude.”
“What is it, Professor?”

“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his
robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop
potion ingredients, “that we are required to make payment to pass.”
“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door something?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much mistaken.”
“Blood?”

“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even
disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards
Dumbledore expected. “The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is
that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord
Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than
physical injury.”

“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .” said Harry, who had experienced
enough pain not to be keen for more.
“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said Dumbledore, shaking back
the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.
“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his
knife. “I’ll do it, I’m —”

He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter? But
Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of
scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.

“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his
wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed
instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds. “But your blood is
worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn’t it?”
The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more,
and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply
vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness.

“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked through the
archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected
in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from
the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety
blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have
expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into
the water. Stay close to me.”

He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind
him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of
rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not
vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the
boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which
was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence
oppressive, unnerving.

“Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the Horcrux is here?”
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do
we get to it?”

“We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?” Harry said,
sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was
prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry
almost walked into him. “Why don’t you do it?”
“Me? Oh . . . okay . . .”

Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand
aloft, “Accio Horcrux!”
With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out
of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it
was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep
ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the
wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.
“What was that?”
“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize
the Horcrux.”

Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more
shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s
heart, however, was still pounding.
“Did you think that would happen, sir?”
“I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get
our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the
simplest way of finding out what we are facing.”
“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, looking at the
sinisterly smooth water.

“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I doubt very much
that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?”
“Professor?”
“Yes, Harry?”
“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?”
“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.”
“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?”
“Oh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the middle.”
And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the
lake.
“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?”
“Yes, I think so.”
Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of
giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .

“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really
did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water,
and Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm,
pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand
back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.”
Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was
exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed
to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his
hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting
to find and grip something invisible.

“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in
midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to
the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore’s buckled
shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in
midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with
the point.

Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air,
extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore’s clenched hand.
Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a
snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily
off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water.
Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing
as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on
the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.

“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonishment.
“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank
with a gentle bump, “sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom
Riddle. I know his style.”
“Is . . . is this boat safe?”
“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake
without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in
case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.”
“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in
Voldemort’s boat?”

“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point,
realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well.
They have allowed us to raise the boat.”
“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake off the
vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of
sight of the bank.

“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very
great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said Dumbledore. “I
think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most
unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had
set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall
see whether he is right.”

Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small.
“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us?
Will we be too heavy together?”
Dumbledore chuckled.

“Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of
magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have
been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to
sail in it.”
“But then — ?”

“I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified.
Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this
place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.”
These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; perhaps Dumbledore
knew it, for he added, “Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s
mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . .

Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.”
Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat.
Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were
crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his
knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There
was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the
water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling
it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the
walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no
waves.

Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling
and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep
ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .
And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface.
“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent
water.

“Harry?”
“I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!”
“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly.
Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a
sick feeling rose in his throat.
“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?”
But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight
had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man
lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though
with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.
“There are bodies in here!” said Harry, and his voice sounded much
higher than usual and most unlike his own.

“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need to worry about
them at the moment.”
“At the moment?” Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look
at Dumbledore.

“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,” said
Dumbledore. “There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more
than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who
of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own
lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and
darkness, nothing more.”

Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that
there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and,
what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.
“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his voice as level and
calm as Dumbledore’s. “When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt
out of the lake.”

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we
shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in
cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call
to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,” Dumbledore added with a
smile, in response to Harry’s bewildered expression.

“Oh . . . right . . .” said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the
greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could
not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with
the dead .  .  . It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor
Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis.  .  .  . He
suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn’t
seen Ginny at all. . . .

“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.
Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and
within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something
that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he
saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the
lake.

“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore again as Harry
climbed out of the boat.

The island was no larger than Dumbledore’s office, an expanse of flat
dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light,
which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at
first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light
was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on
top of a pedestal.

Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they
looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that
phosphorescent glow.

“What is it?” asked Harry quietly.
“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore. “Something more worrisome than
blood and bodies, however.”
Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand,
and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the
potion.

“Sir, no, don’t touch — !”
“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. “See? I cannot
approach any nearer than this. You try.”
Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the
potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an
inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing
but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air.

“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand
and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion,
murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion
glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked,
but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe
to talk again.

“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished,
parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed,
or otherwise made to change its nature.”

Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it
once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out
of nowhere.

“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what
lies in its depths.”

“But what if — what if it kills you?”
“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said Dumbledore easily. “Lord
Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.”
Harry couldn’t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore’s insane
determination to see good in everyone?
“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, “sir, this is
Voldemort we’re —”

“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately
kill the person who reached this island,” Dumbledore corrected himself.
“He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they
managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of
all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that
Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.”

Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for
silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.
“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act in a way that will
prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget
what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me
incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job
to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my
protesting mouth. You understand?”

Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green
light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along — so
that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him
unendurable pain?

“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on which I brought
you with me?”
Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the
reflected light of the basin.
“But what if — ?”

“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?”
“Yes, but —”
“I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and
raising the empty goblet, “you have my orders.”

“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry desperately.
“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,” said
Dumbledore. “Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do
all in your power to make me keep drinking?”
“Couldn’t — ?”

“Do I have it?”
“But —”
“Your word, Harry.”
“I — all right, but —”
Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the
crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would
not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the
surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim,
Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.

“Your good health, Harry.”
And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping
the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.
“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass.
“How do you feel?”

Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he
was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin,
refilled it, and drank once more.

In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then,
halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the
basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.
“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice strained. “Can you hear
me?”

Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was
deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was
slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and
grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady.
“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his voice echoing
around the cavern.

Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize,
for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.
“I don’t want . . . Don’t make me . . .”

Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose
and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do.
“. . . don’t like . . . want to stop . . .” moaned Dumbledore.
“You  .  .  . you can’t stop, Professor,” said Harry. “You’ve got to keep
drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . .”
Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet
back toward Dumbledore’s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank
the remainder of the potion inside.

“No . . .” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and
refilled it for him. “I don’t want to. . . . I don’t want to. . . . Let me go. . . .”
“It’s all right, Professor,” said Harry, his hand shaking. “It’s all right, I’m
here —”

“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore.
“Yes . . . yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry. He tipped the contents of
the goblet into Dumbledore’s open mouth.
Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber,
across the dead black water.

“No, no, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, don’t make me, I don’t want to. . . .”
“It’s all right, Professor, it’s all right!” said Harry loudly, his hands
shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the
basin was now half empty. “Nothing’s happening to you, you’re safe, it isn’t
real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now, take this. . . .”
And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry
offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking
uncontrollably.

“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed. “Please make it stop, I know I
did wrong, oh please make it stop and I’ll never, never again . . .”
“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his voice cracking as he
tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore’s mouth.
Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded
him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s
trembling hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them, please,
please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead . . .”

“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said Harry desperately,
and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept
his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.

And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the
ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet.

“Please, please, please, no . . . not that, not that, I’ll do anything . . .”
“Just drink, Professor, just drink . . .”
Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished,
he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. “No more, please, no
more . . .”
Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape
the bottom of the basin.

“We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. . . .”
He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained
the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as
Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want to die! I
want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!”
“Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .”
Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, “KILL
ME!”
“This — this one will!” gasped Harry. “Just drink this . . . It’ll be over . . .
all over!”

Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with
a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.
“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he
dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and
heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were askew, his
mouth agape, his eyes closed. “No,” said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, “no,
you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up —
Rennervate!” he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledore’s chest; there was
a flash of red light but nothing happened. “Rennervate — sir — please —”
Dumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart leapt.
“Sir, are you — ?”

“Water,” croaked Dumbledore.
“Water,” panted Harry. “Yes —”
He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he
barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.
“Aguamenti!” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside
Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was
empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.

“But I had some — wait — Aguamenti!” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.
“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was
drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. “Aguamenti —
Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI!”

The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively,
the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into
the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.
“Sir — here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water
clumsily over Dumbledore’s face.

It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the
cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped
his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly,
backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirrorsmooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and
hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children
with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the
dead rising from the black water.

“Petrificus Totalus!” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth,
soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had
his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he
scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the
rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted
eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.

“Petrificus Totalus!” Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped
his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were
coming toward him. “Impedimenta! Incarcerous!”

A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those
climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen
bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled,
“Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!”

But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they
had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands
outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms
enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and his feet left
the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely,
back to the water, and he knew there would be no release, that he would be
drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort’s
shattered soul. . . .

But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of
fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly
stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to
the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and
fell, grazing his arms, but scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring
around.

Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi,
but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like
a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling
them all with warmth.

The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire
in which they were enclosed. . . .
Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and
stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his
side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry
was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire
moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them
to the water’s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark
waters.

Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore
might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he
attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of
protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his
seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to
move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by
that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not
dare resurface.

“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they were coming at
me and I panicked —”
“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to
hear how faint his voice was.

They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned
quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the
bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did
not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once
more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too.
Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.
“I am weak. . . .” he said.

“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore’s
extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. “Don’t worry, I’ll get us
back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .”

And pulling Dumbledore’s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry
guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.
“The protection was . . . after all . . . well-designed,” said Dumbledore
faintly. “One alone could not have done it.  .  .  . You did well, very well,
Harry. . . .”

“Don’t talk now,” said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore’s voice
had become, how much his feet dragged. “Save your energy, sir. . . . We’ll
soon be out of here. . . .”
“The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife . . .”
“There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry firmly. “Just tell me
where. . . .”
“Here . . .”

Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having received its
tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer
cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled
the crevice in the cliff.

“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and over again, more
worried by Dumbledore’s silence than he had been by his weakened voice.
“We’re nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both back. . . . Don’t worry. . . .”
“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger
despite the freezing water. “I am with you.”


CHAPTER  TWENTY-SEVEN

THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER

nce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore onto the
top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering,
Dumbledore’s weight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder than he had
ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping
Dumbledore’s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward into that
feeling of horrible compression.

He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The smell of salt, the
sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in
the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment
Harry’s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping toward him around
the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was
still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly
realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest. “We did it! We got the
Horcrux!”

Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his
inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw his
face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.
“Sir, are you all right?”

“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his
mouth twitched. “That potion . . . was no health drink. . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground.
“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t worry —”
He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen
and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly
to the hospital wing.

“We need to get you up to the school, sir. . . . Madam Pomfrey . . .”
“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is . . . Professor Snape whom I need. . . . But
I do not think . . . I can walk very far just yet. . . .”
“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, find a place you can
stay — then I can run and get Madam —”
“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus. . . .”
“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave you for a
moment so I can —”

Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard running footsteps.
His heart leapt: Somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help —
and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark
street toward them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing
gown embroidered with dragons.
“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank
goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t think what to — but what’s wrong
with Albus?”

She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore.
“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three
Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?”
“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — haven’t you seen —
?”

“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not listening to her, “I think we
can get him inside —”
“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. “Rosmerta, what’s wrong?”
“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.”

And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded
Harry at the sound of the words. . . . He turned and looked.
There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green skull
with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had
entered a building . . . wherever they had murdered. . . .
“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched
painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.
“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat out, but
when I got upstairs —”

“We need to return to the castle at once,” said Dumbledore. “Rosmerta”
— and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the
situation — “we need transport — brooms —”
“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking very frightened.
“Shall I run and fetch — ?”
“No, Harry can do it.”
Harry raised his wand at once.
“Accio Rosmerta’s Brooms!”

A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst
open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to
Harry’s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at waist height.
“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dumbledore, as
he mounted the broom nearest him. “It might be that nobody within
Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong.  .  .  . Harry, put on your
Invisibility Cloak.”

Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before
mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward
her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up
into the air. As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced sideways at
Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark
Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent
low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and
beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too looked ahead at the
skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his
lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind. . . .

How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny’s luck
run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over
the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the D.A.?
And if it was . . . he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors,
he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds.  .  .  . Would he be
responsible, again, for the death of a friend?

As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked
earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears,
Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he
understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the
boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the

enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at
speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower,
the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?
Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was
dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around.
The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back
into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the
death, of a body.

“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green
skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them. “Is it the real
Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?”

In the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw Dumbledore clutching
at his chest with his blackened hand.

“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. “Tell him
what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody
else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.”
“But —”

“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!”
Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand
had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running
footsteps on the other side. He looked around at Dumbledore, who gestured
him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.
The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted,
“Expelliarmus!”

Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself
fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to
move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened —
Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm —
Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore’s wand flying in an
arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood.  .  .  . Dumbledore had
wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the
spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.

Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still
showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his
disarmer and said, “Good evening, Draco.”
Malfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that he and
Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.
“Who else is here?”

“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”
Harry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish
glare of the Mark.

“No,” he said. “I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your
school tonight.”
“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an
ambitious homework project. “Very good indeed. You found a way to let
them in, did you?”

“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under your nose and you
never realized!”
“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet . . . forgive me . . . where are they
now? You seem unsupported.”

“They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight down below.
They won’t be long. . . . I came on ahead. I — I’ve got a job to do.”
“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” said Dumbledore
softly.

There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible,
paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds
of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did
nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, who, incredibly, smiled.
“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”
“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw
him flush in the Mark’s greenish light.
“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy more forcefully.
“You don’t know what I’ve done!”

“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed Katie Bell
and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to
kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts. . . .
So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in
it.”

“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been working on it all
year, and tonight —”
Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell.
Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.
“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said Dumbledore
conversationally. “But you were saying  .  .  . yes, you have managed to
introduce Death Eaters into my school, which, I admit, I thought
impossible. . . . How did you do it?”

But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was
happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was.
“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested Dumbledore.
“What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps
realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too.
And after all, you don’t really need help.  .  .  . I have no wand at the
moment. . . . I cannot defend myself.”
Malfoy merely stared at him.

“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke.
“You are afraid to act until they join you.”
“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt
Dumbledore. “It’s you who should be scared!”
“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as
easy as the innocent believe.  .  .  . So tell me, while we wait for your
friends . . . how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a
long time to work out how to do it.”

Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to
vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his
wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though he could not
help himself, he said, “I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no
one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.”
“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a
moment. “That was clever. . . . There is a pair, I take it?”

“In Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make a kind of passage
between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts
one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going
on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the cabinet
was traveling between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear him. . . . In
the end, he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his
test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story,
but I was the only one who realized what it meant — even Borgin didn’t
know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts
through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one.”

“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death Eaters were able to
pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you. . . . A clever plan,
a very clever plan . . . and, as you say, right under my nose.”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort
from Dumbledore’s praise. “Yeah, it was!”

“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t there, when you
were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet? And you resorted
to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace
that was bound to reach the wrong hands  .  .  . poisoning mead there was
only the slightest chance I might drink. . . .”

“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?”
sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength
in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely,
against the enchantment binding him.

“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was sure it was you.”
“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded.
“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my
orders —”

“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother —”
“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but —”
“He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t working for you, you
just think he is!”

“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust
Professor Snape —”
“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. “He’s been
offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a
bit of the action — ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do the necklace, that
was stupid, it could have blown everything —’ But I haven’t told him what
I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he’s going to wake up
tomorrow and it’ll all be over and he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite
anymore, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!”

“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like appreciation for
our own hard work, of course. But you must have had an accomplice, all the
same . . . someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the
— the — aaaah . . .”
Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to
fall asleep. “. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she been under the
Imperius Curse?”

“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted.
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy
looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who
went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and
pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room
unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was
able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing
that it was to be my Christmas present. . . . Yes, very neat . . . very neat . . .

Poor Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s.
Tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we
had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.”
“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep
talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. “I had one and she had
the other and I could send her messages —”

“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called
themselves Dumbledore’s Army used last year?” asked Dumbledore. His
voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower
down the wall as he said it.

“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. “I
got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well, I
heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions.”
“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said Dumbledore.
Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. “You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when
I’m about to kill you?”

“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the
floor as he struggled to remain upright. “But as for being about to kill me,
Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am
more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you
have not acted. . . .”

Malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted
something very bitter.
“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a little puzzled about
how it happened. . . . You knew that I had left the school? But of course,”
he answered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you
off using your ingenious coins, I’m sure.”
“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were just going for a drink,
you’d be back. . . .”

“Well, I certainly did have a drink  .  .  . and I came back  .  .  . after a
fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore. “So you decided to spring a trap for me?”
“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up
here, to see who’d been killed,” said Malfoy. “And it worked!”
“Well . . . yes and no . . .” said Dumbledore. “But am I to take it, then,
that nobody has been murdered?”

“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an octave
as he said it. “One of your people . . . I don’t know who, it was dark. . . . I
stepped over the body. . . . I was supposed to be waiting up here when you
got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way. . . .”
“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore.

There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as
though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where
Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry’s heart thundered unheard
in his invisible chest. . . . Someone was dead. . . . Malfoy had stepped over
the body . . . but who was it?

“There is little time, one way or another,” said Dumbledore. “So let us
discuss your options, Draco.”
“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here with a wand —
I’m about to kill you —”

“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were going
to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would
not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”
“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as
Dumbledore. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!”
“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore. “Why
else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew
that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I
suspected you.”

Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.
“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had
been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,” continued
Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to each other. . . . No
harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that
your unintentional victims survived. . . . I can help you, Draco.”
“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed.
“Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”

“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more
completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send
members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your
father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the time comes, we can
protect him too. . . . Come over to the right side, Draco . . . you are not a
killer. . . .”

Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.
“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die in the
attempt, but I’m here . . . and you’re in my power. . . . I’m the one with the
wand. . . . You’re at my mercy. . . .”
“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not yours,
that matters now.”

Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still
trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction —
But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second later
Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst
through the door onto the ramparts. Still paralyzed, his eyes staring
unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: It seemed the Death
Eaters had won the fight below.

A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.
“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman
who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly.
“Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!”
“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as though
welcoming the man to a tea party. “And you’ve brought Alecto too.  .  .  .
Charming . . .”

The woman gave an angry little titter. “Think your little jokes’ll help you
on your deathbed then?” she jeered.
“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied Dumbledore.
“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with
matted gray hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater’s robes looked
uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a
rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt,
sweat, and, unmistakably, blood coming from him. His filthy hands had
long yellowish nails.

“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore.
“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?”
“No, I cannot say that I am.”
Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin
and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.
“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.”
“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now?
This is most unusual. . . . You have developed a taste for human flesh that
cannot be satisfied once a month?”

“That’s right,” said Fenrir Greyback. “Shocks you that, does it,
Dumbledore? Frightens you?”
“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said Dumbledore.
“And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people,
into the school where his friends live. . . .”

“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Fenrir; he did not
seem to want to even glance at him. “I didn’t know he was going to come
—”
“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,” rasped
Greyback. “Not when there are throats to be ripped out  .  .  . Delicious,
delicious . . .”
And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at
Dumbledore. “I could do you for afters, Dumbledore.”
“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking
face. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.”
Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he
stared into Dumbledore’s face, which was even paler, and rather lower than
usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.

“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” said the lopsided
man, to the accompaniment of his sister’s wheezing giggles. “Look at him
— what’s happened to you, then, Dumby?”
“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” said Dumbledore.
“Old age, in short . . . One day, perhaps, it will happen to you . . . if you are
lucky. . . .”

“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled the Death Eater,
suddenly violent. “Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and
doing nothing, nothing. I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s bothering
to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!”

But at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below
and a voice shouted, “They’ve blocked the stairs — Reducto! REDUCTO!”
Harry’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated all opposition, but
merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower, and, by the sound of
it, created a barrier behind them —
“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man angrily.
But Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.
“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his hands
outstretched, his teeth bared.

“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and
the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered,
looking furious. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible
that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore’s
spell — if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak
—

“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us —” screeched the woman, but at
that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and
there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the
scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters,
including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.
“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and
wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able —”
But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite softly.
“Severus . . .”

The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all
evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.
Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out
of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the
werewolf seemed cowed.

Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and
hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.
“Severus . . . please . . .”
Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.
“Avada Kedavra!”

A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit
Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s scream of horror never left him;
silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted
into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the
shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over
the battlements and out of sight.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT

FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE

arry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not
happened. . . . It could not have happened. . . .
“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape.

He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the
door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed,
the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry
realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against
the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility
Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was
disappearing through the door.

“Petrificus Totalus!”
The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid
and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor
when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened
staircase.

Terror tore at Harry’s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore and he had
to catch Snape.  .  .  . Somehow the two things were linked.  .  .  . He could
reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . . Dumbledore
could not have died. . . .

He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he
landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the
ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but
even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom, he heard the
hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go!” and saw Snape disappearing
around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to
have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after
them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at
him: It was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry
could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his
face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy
breath at his throat —

“Petrificus Totalus!”
Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed
the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying
toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met
something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were
two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no
time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of
him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus,
who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was
giggling, enjoying the sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever,
pretty —”

“Impedimenta!” yelled Harry.
His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was
lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell
out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom
was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks
fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all
directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone,
shattering the nearest window —

“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but there was no time
to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly
avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of
wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape —
“Take that!” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the
female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms
over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them
but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across
someone’s legs. Looking around, he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat
against the floor.

“Neville, are you — ?”
“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach,
“Harry . . . Snape ’n’ Malfoy . . . ran past . . .”

“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the
enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man
gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around,
staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry
scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring
the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and
the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet
know. . . .

He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had
an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the
cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure
it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing
but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along
the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at
least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors —
perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked —

He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived
behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running
down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit
several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching
into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard
more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have
awoken. . . .

He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and
close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds
by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the
concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a
corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.
“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark
Mark —” began Ernie Macmillan.

“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted
toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak
front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the
flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls,
one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant
Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were
still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.

Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He
could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the
gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the looks of them, the
huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy . . .
The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a
flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did
not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a
good aim with a curse —

Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood:
Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters
escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch
in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head
said: not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . .

Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell
forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils:
He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister
he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .
“Impedimenta!” he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the
dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and
fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after
Snape.

And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of
the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater
was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrid’s immense
strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother
seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still
running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate —
Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape’s back, and
yelled, “Stupefy!”

He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s head; Snape shouted,
“Run, Draco!” and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each
other before raising their wands simultaneously.
“Cruc —”

But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before
he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the
huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendio!” Harry heard an explosive
bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house
was on fire.

“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed.
“Cruc —” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead
illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again.
Harry could see him sneering.

“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the rushing
of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang.
“You haven’t got the nerve or the ability —”
“Incarc —” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost
lazy flick of his arm.

“Fight back!” Harry screamed at him. “Fight back, you cowardly —”
“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. “Your father would
never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I
wonder?”

“Stupe —”
“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth
shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse
once more. “Now come!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry.
“It is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up —”
“Impedi —”

But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he
keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of
this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness —
“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had
started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting;
somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you forgotten our orders?
Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him! Go! Go!”

And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister
and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry
uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he
lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward
Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself —
“Sectum — !”

Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry
was mere feet away now and he could see Snape’s face clearly at last: He
was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of
rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi —
“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was
soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand
flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as
Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and
defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the
flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had
cursed Dumbledore.

“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented
them — I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you’d turn my inventions on me,
like your filthy father, would you? I don’t think so . . . no!”
Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away
into the darkness and out of sight.

“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and
contempt. “Kill me like you killed him, you coward —”
“DON’T —” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented,
inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog
stuck in the burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!”

And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit
him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of
light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to
have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and
something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who
staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry
raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last
contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the
enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never
heard him screech —

Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping
to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding
twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had
located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates.
Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.
“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. “HAGRID?”

He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged
from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of
thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his
body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.
“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, Harry. . . .”
Hagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the
stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt
Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.
“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?”

“’Course I am . . . take more’n that ter finish me.”
Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised him up with such
force that Harry’s feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him
upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid’s cheek from a
deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.
“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the charm’s ‘Aguamenti’
. . .”

“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a
smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti!”
A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm,
which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti” too: Together, he and
Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.
“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the
smoking wreck. “Nothin’ Dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ . . .”
Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the
silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.

“Hagrid . . .”
“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em comin’,”
said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. “They’ll’ve bin burnt
ter twigs, poor little things. . . .”
“Hagrid . . .”

“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down
from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s
he gone — was he chasin’ them?”
“He . . .” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”

“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.

“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”

Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head,
that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking
uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. . . . As they
directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its
windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as
people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had
got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have
been killed. . . .

The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the
drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were
creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the
Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry’s eyes, however, were fixed
upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could
see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too
far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the
place where he thought Dumbledore’s body must lie, however, he saw
people beginning to move toward it.

“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached
the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. “Wha’s
tha’, lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the
foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. “See
it, Harry? Righ’ at the foot o’ the tower? Under where the Mark  .  .  .
Blimey . . . yeh don’ think someone got thrown — ?”
Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud.
Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his
legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an
oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them.
What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his
chest. . . .

He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the
very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.
Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he
walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay
and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the
moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him
lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead,
but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled,
broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.

Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and
legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the halfmoon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from
the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face
and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never
again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help. . . .
The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time,
he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked
down.

The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out
of Dumbledore’s pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which
it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or
sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was
something wrong. . . .

He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the
locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings
upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherin’s mark.
Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment
wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.
Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry
pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the
many wands that had now been lit behind him:

To the Dark Lord
I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know
that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be
mortal once more.
R.A.B.
Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing
mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by
drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in
his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-NINE

THE PHOENIX LAMENT

’mere, Harry . . .”
“No.”
“Yeh can’ stay here, Harry. . . . Come on, now. . . .”
“No.”
He did not want to leave Dumbledore’s side, he did not want to move
anywhere. Hagrid’s hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another
voice said, “Harry, come on.”

A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him
upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he
walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of
flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into
the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails
stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into
the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, people were
peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on
the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble
staircase.

“We’re going to the hospital wing,” said Ginny.
“I’m not hurt,” said Harry.
“It’s McGonagall’s orders,” said Ginny. “Everyone’s up there, Ron and
Hermione and Lupin and everyone —”
Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he
had left behind.

“Ginny, who else is dead?”
“Don’t worry, none of us.”
“But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a body —”
“He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive.”
There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.
“Are you sure?”

“Of course I’m sure . . . he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s all. Greyback
attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look the same
anymore. . . .”
Ginny’s voice trembled a little.
“We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean, Greyback
being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.”

“But the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .”
“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says
they’ll be all right. And a Death Eater’s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse
that huge blond one was firing off everywhere — Harry, if we hadn’t had
your Felix potion, I think we’d all have been killed, but everything seemed
to just miss us —”

They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw
Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione,
Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end
of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up.
Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking
anxious.

“Are you all right, Harry?”
“I’m fine. . . . How’s Bill?”

Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione’s shoulder and saw an
unrecognizable face lying on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that
he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with
some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had
mended Malfoy’s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.

“Can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he asked the matron.
“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ve tried
everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.”
“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who was gazing down
into his brother’s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just
by staring. “Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be a — a
real — ?”

He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” said Lupin, “but that
does not mean that there won’t be some contamination. Those are cursed
wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill might have
some wolfish characteristics from now on.”

“Dumbledore might know something that’d work, though,” Ron said.
“Where is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore’s orders,
Dumbledore owes him, he can’t leave him in this state —”
“Ron — Dumbledore’s dead,” said Ginny.

“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the
latter might contradict her, but when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a
chair beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin
lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something
private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, exchanging
in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.

“How did he die?” whispered Tonks. “How did it happen?”
“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on
the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore
was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard
footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn’t do anything,
I was under the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the
door and disarmed him —”

Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Luna’s
mouth trembled.
“— more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — and Snape did it.
The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn’t go on.
Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except
Ginny, who whispered, “Shh! Listen!”

Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes
wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way
Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And
Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was
inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that
echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.

How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it
seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but
it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and
Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of
the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.

“Molly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the spell of the music
was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances,
turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyes, shake their
heads. “Harry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with
Professor Dumbledore when he — when it happened. He says Professor
Snape was involved in some —”
“Snape killed Dumbledore,” said Harry.

She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam
Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward,
conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.
“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. “We all
wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape . . . I can’t believe it. . . .”
“Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said Lupin, his voice
uncharacteristically harsh. “We always knew that.”
“But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!” whispered Tonks. “I
always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we
didn’t. . . .”

“He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,”
muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking
eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. “I mean . . . with Snape’s history . . .
of course people were bound to wonder  .  .  . but Dumbledore told me
explicitly that Snape’s repentance was absolutely genuine.  .  .  . Wouldn’t
hear a word against him!”

“I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,” said Tonks.
“I know,” said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. “Snape passed
Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and
dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he was doing, he
was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that they were dead.”
They all stared at him.

“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Lupin incredulously.
“Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated
James. . . .”

“And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn either,” said Harry,
“because she was Muggle-born. . . . ‘Mudblood,’ he called her. . . .”
Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in
horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked
disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. “My fault. I sent
Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If
I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined
forces with the Death Eaters. I don’t think he knew they were there before
Filius told him, I don’t think he knew they were coming.”

“It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly. “We all wanted more
help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way. . . .”
“So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters’ side?”
asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape’s duplicity and infamy,
feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.

“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor McGonagall
distractedly. “It’s all so confusing.  .  .  . Dumbledore had told us that he
would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the
corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us . . .
and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the
school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful
enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don’t know how the
Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .”

“I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing
Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. “So they got in through the
Room of Requirement.”
Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom
looked devastated.

“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly. “We did like you told us: We
checked the Marauder’s Map and we couldn’t see Malfoy on it, so we
thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville
went to keep watch on it . . . but Malfoy got past us.”

“He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,”
said Ginny. “He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm —”
“His Hand of Glory,” said Ron. “Gives light only to the holder,
remember?”

“Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been checking whether the
coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us
he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black —”
“— Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron bitterly. “Fred and
George’s. I’m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy
their products.”

“We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,” said Ginny. “Nothing would
penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the
corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us.
Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding
them, but we didn’t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each
other, and by the time we’d reached a corridor that was light, they’d gone.”

“Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran into us
almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death
Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower.
Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more people to be on the watch; he
seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A
fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon,
broke away and headed up the tower stairs —”

“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry.
“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left
the Room of Requirement,” said Lupin. “But I don’t think Gibbon liked the
idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running
back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just
missed me.”

“So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and
Neville,” said Harry, turning to Hermione, “were you — ?”

“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling
with tears, “with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing
happened. . . . We didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken
the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting
down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I
don’t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just
burst his way into Snape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to
go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came
hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and —”

“What?” Harry urged her.
“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. “He
said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care
of him while he — while he went to help fight the Death Eaters —” She
covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her
voice was muffled. “We went into his office to see if we could help
Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor . . . and oh, it’s
so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize,
Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!”

“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly. “Hermione, had you not obeyed
Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and
Luna.”

“So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was watching Snape running
up the marble staircase in his mind’s eye, his black robes billowing behind
him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, “and he
found the place where you were all fighting. . . .”

“We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a low voice.
“Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to
the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback . . . It
was all dark  .  .  . curses flying everywhere  .  .  . The Malfoy boy had
vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran
after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of
curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air —”

“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that massive Death
Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off
the walls and barely missing us. . . .”

“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then he wasn’t —”
“I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater’s jinx just
missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,” said
Ginny.

“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t
there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like
Neville. . . .”

“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGonagall. “After
all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . I just assumed
that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d escaped up to
the tower. . . .”

“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them . . .
and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so
what happened when he came back down?”
“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the
ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,” said Lupin.
“We all ran forward — those of us who were still standing anyway — and
then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust — obviously, none of us
attacked them —”

“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice. “We thought they
were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next thing, the other Death
Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again — I thought I
heard Snape shout something, but I don’t know what —”

“He shouted, ‘It’s over,’” said Harry. “He’d done what he’d meant to do.”
They all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echoing over the dark
grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden,
unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry’s mind.  .  .  . Had they taken
Dumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to
it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. He
could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of
his right hand.

The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her
beautiful face terrified.

“Molly — Arthur —” said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and
hurrying to greet them. “I am so sorry —”

“Bill,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as
she caught sight of Bill’s mangled face. “Oh, Bill!”

Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and
pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.

“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr. Weasley asked Professor
McGonagall distractedly. “But he hadn’t transformed? So what does that
mean? What will happen to Bill?”

“We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at
Lupin.
“There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,” said Lupin. “It is
an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don’t know what his behavior might
be like when he awakens. . . .”

Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey
and began dabbing at Bill’s wounds.
“And Dumbledore . . .” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true . . . Is he
really . . . ?”

As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and
looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was
gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes
only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.

“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks.  .  .  . It’s not r-really
important  .  .  . but he was a very handsome little b-boy  .  .  . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What
do you mean, ‘’e was going to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”

“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded Fleur.
“You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”
“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and
throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a
werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given
how — how he —”

“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”
said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am goodlooking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my
husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fiercely, pushing Mrs.
Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.

Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping
up Bill’s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody
said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was
waiting for the explosion.

“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, “has a
very beautiful tiara — goblin-made — which I am sure I could persuade her
to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it
would look lovely with your hair.”

“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”
And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were
crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether
the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt
and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.

“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely —”
“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of
Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million times. . . .”

And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and
the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a
rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear
to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her
eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor  .  .  . too
dangerous. . . .”

“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said
Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder as she patted her on the back.
“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. “Tonks deserves
somebody young and whole.”

“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And after
all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.”
He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.

“This is  .  .  . not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding
everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly. “Dumbledore is dead.
. . .”

“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there
was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just
as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.
The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking
and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his
hand.

“I’ve . . . I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked. “M-moved him. Professor
Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick’s lyin’ down, but he
says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn says the Ministry’s
bin informed.”

“Thank you, Hagrid,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once
and turning to look at the group around Bill’s bed. “I shall have to see the
Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses —
Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I want to see them in my office
forthwith. I would like you to join us too.”

As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked
down at Harry. “Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you,
Harry. If you’ll come with me. . . .”

Harry stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to Ron, Hermione, and
Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The
corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix
song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not
heading for Professor McGonagall’s office, but for Dumbledore’s, and
another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy
headmistress. . . . Apparently she was now headmistress . . . so the room
behind the gargoyle was now hers.

In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the
circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would
be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore’s body might be lying
there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and
Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments
whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables, Gryffindor’s sword in
its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind
the desk. But Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to
the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead
headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering
in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacles perched upon his
crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.

After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd
movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at
Harry, her face taut and lined.

“Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor
Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.”
“I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had expected the
question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that
Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their
lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.

“Harry, it might be important,” said Professor McGonagall.
“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.”
Professor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry registered the
renewed use of his surname — “in the light of Professor Dumbledore’s
death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat —”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor Dumbledore never
told me to stop following his orders if he died.”

“But —”
“There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here,
though. Madam Rosmerta’s under the Imperius Curse, she was helping
Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace and the poisoned
mead —”

“Rosmerta?” said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she
could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors
Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid,
who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.
“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and
sweating. “Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!”

But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from
high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just
walked back into his empty canvas.

“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just
Disapparated from the Ministry.”
“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, and she turned
quickly to her teachers.

“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,” she
said quickly. “Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen
next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues
is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts’s history. It is horrible.”

“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,”
said Professor Sprout. “I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the
school ought to remain open for that pupil.”

“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said Slughorn, now dabbing
his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. “Parents will want to keep
their children at home and I can’t say I blame them. Personally, I don’t
think we’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you
can’t expect mothers to think like that. They’ll want to keep their families
together, it’s only natural.”

“I agree,” said Professor McGonagall. “And in any case, it is not true to
say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might
close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of
the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more
disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in
the bowels of the castle. . . .”

“We must consult the governors,” said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky
little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise
unscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office. “We must follow the
established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.”
“Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor McGonagall. “What
are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?”

Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted
handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and
croaked, “I dunno, Professor  .  .  . that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the
headmistress ter decide . . .”

“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” said Professor
McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.”
“Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners
of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin
me home since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me ter teach
’em, I’ll do it. But . . . I dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He
gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was
silence.

“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at
the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching,
“then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the
governors, who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it
sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to
come tomorrow if necessary —”

“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as
her voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to
rest here, at Hogwarts —”

“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,”
growled Hagrid.

“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said Professor
Flitwick.
“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.
“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students home
until the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say —”
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the
sentence for him.

“Good-bye.”
“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our
students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home
afterward.”
“Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout.

“I suppose . . . yes . . .” said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while
Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.
“He’s coming,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into
the grounds. “The Minister  .  . . and by the looks of it, he’s brought a
delegation . . .”

“Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once.
He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour
tonight.

“You may,” said Professor McGonagall. “And quickly.”
She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the
spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his
Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter;
there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs.
Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the
passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.

“Is it true?” whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. “It is really
true? Dumbledore — dead?”

“Yes,” said Harry.
She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward
to admit him.

As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed.
The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean
and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must
be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye
contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door
to the boys’ dormitories.

As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on
his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment, they
simply stared at each other.
“They’re talking about closing the school,” said Harry.
“Lupin said they would,” said Ron.

There was a pause.
“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture
might be listening in. “Did you find one? Did you get it? A — a Horcrux?”
Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake
seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours
ago?

“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It wasn’t there?”
“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its
place.”

“Already taken — ?”
Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and
passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. . . . It did not matter tonight . . .
nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the
end of Dumbledore’s life. . . .

“R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring
blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that
he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware
suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing.
And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had
gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school,
had left the world . . . had left Harry.


CHAPTER  THIRTY

THE WHITE TOMB

ll lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some
students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the
next couple of days — the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the
morning following Dumbledore’s death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted
from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the
other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a
shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that
he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed
in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were
pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Dumbledore.

Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had
never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house,
pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in
the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest.
Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned,
black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the
waiting Hagrid’s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials,
including the Minister of Magic himself, was being accommodated within
the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was
sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for
Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all of their time
together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine
how it would have been if Dumbledore had not died, and they had had this
time together at the very end of the year, Ginny’s examinations finished, the
pressure of homework lifted  .  . . and hour by hour, he put off saying the
thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew was right to do,
because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.

They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged,
but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as
ever — in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody,
though thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed
just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now
had a great liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”

“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to
marry her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room,
looking out over the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as
Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing
the Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape but
no sign . . .”

“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”
“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that
well since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two,
and departed for the girls’ dormitories. The moment the door had closed
behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermioneish look on her face.
“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library.”
“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight.

He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious,
burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of
discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he
could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead
of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and
which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as
many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to be
found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort
could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing
them he could bring them within reach: the locket  .  .  . the cup  .  .  . the
snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s . . . the locket . . . the
cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s . . .
This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as he fell asleep at
night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects
that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a
rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb. . . .

He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after
Dumbledore’s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the
initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been
reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than
was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.
“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I haven’t found
anything.  . . . There are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with
those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs  .  .  . Rupert ‘Axebanger’
Brookstanton . . . but they don’t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the
person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of
evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him. . . .
No, actually, it’s about . . . well, Snape.”
She looked nervous even saying the name again.

“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.
“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince
business,” she said tentatively.
“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around
to check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored
him.

“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape,
and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must
have been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a
Muggle from what it said in the Prophet.”

“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he
could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them.  .  .  . He’s just like
Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage,
trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an
impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how
could Dumbledore have missed — ?”

He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself
dwelling upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape  .  .  . but as
Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in
just the same.  .  .  . In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled
spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who
had helped him so much. . . .

Helped him . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.
“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron.
“He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”
“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra.
He didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before
then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions.  .  .  .
Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”

“I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,” said
Hermione. “I don’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he’d
known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn would
have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape’s
old classroom, and I’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called
‘Prince.’”

“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “All that time
he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school,
and I had proof Snape was too —”
“‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly.
“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!”
“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on yourself.
I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor, but I would
never have guessed he was a potential killer. . . .”

“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would . . . you know,” said Ron.
Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but
Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following
morning, when Dumbledore’s body would be laid to rest. He had never
attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had
died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he
might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore’s
death would be more real to him once it was over. Though he had moments
when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank
stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about
anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that
Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius,
looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore
would come back. . . . He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake
Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but
as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.

Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be
leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs, he found the mood in the
Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one
seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in
the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid’s chair was deserted too; Harry
thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but Snape’s
place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided
his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable
feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour’s
entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy
Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing
pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.

Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together.
Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tall,
pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had not
spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had
not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that
he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did
not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised
Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop
of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now,
and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his
parents?

Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny.
Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet, and the mournful hum in the
Hall died away at once.

“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads of Houses out
into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.”

They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed
Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent, long,
emerald green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor
Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single
patch on her hat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they found
Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her
knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.

They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone
steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed
his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place
where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the
center of them: There was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs
facing it. It was the most beautiful summer’s day.

An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the
chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but
a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley
Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to
vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands;
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and
George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was
Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the
landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib
neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters;
Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in
Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as
the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the
Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the
bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering
insubstantially on the gleaming air.

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row
beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a
breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd
continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry
saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna alone of the
D.A. had responded to Hermione’s summons the night that Dumbledore had
died, and Harry knew why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A.
most . . . probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the
hope that there would be another meeting.

Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression
miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized
Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her
red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an
unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow
set atop her iron-colored curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was
standing like a sentinel near the water’s edge, she gave a start and scurried
hastily into a seat a good distance away.

The staff was seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave
and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered
whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that
Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard music, strange, otherworldly
music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the
source of it. He was not the only one: Many heads were turning, searching,
a little alarmed.

“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear.
And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the
surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi: a chorus of merpeople singing
in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their
purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry’s
neck stand up, and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss
and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers, he had
the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore’s passing. Then
Ginny nudged him again and he looked around.

Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was
crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped
in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be
Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry’s throat at this sight: For a
moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore’s body was
so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and
shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny’s and Hermione’s
laps.

They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid
seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated
down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew
scandalized looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge . . .
but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a
friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid’s eyes were so swollen
it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back
row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for
there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was
the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost
human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid
hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a
wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped, and he
turned to face the front again.

A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood
now in front of Dumbledore’s body. Harry could not hear what he was
saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads.
“Nobility of spirit”  .  .  . “intellectual contribution”  .  .  . “greatness of
heart” . . . It did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as
Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore’s idea of a
few words, “nitwit,” “oddment,” “blubber,” and “tweak,” and again had to
suppress a grin. . . . What was the matter with him?

There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople
had broken the surface to listen too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching
at the water’s edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and
conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where
Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked
him, so much he should have said. . . .

And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more
completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead,
gone. . . . He clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but
he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: He looked away from
Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the
little man in black droned on. . . . There was movement among the trees.

The centaurs had come to pay their respects too. They did not move into the
open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half hidden in shadow,
watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry
remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had
ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced
him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not
long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again,
and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never
quite eradicated. . . .

And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people
who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his
father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him;
but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him
and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost
at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing
could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting
whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination;
the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than
he had ever been before.

The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat.
Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches,
probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.

Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around
Dumbledore’s body and the table upon which it lay: Higher and higher they
rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiraled into the air and made
strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw
a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished.
In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore’s body and the
table on which he had rested.

There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared
through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the
centaurs’ tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool
trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and
were lost from view.

Harry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron’s face was screwed up
as though the sunlight were blinding him. Hermione’s face was glazed with
tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry’s gaze with the same
hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning
the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they
understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was
going to do now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but
accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of
him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever
since Dumbledore had died.

“Ginny, listen . . .” he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew
louder around them and people began to get to their feet, “I can’t be
involved with you anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing each other. We can’t
be together.”

She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some stupid, noble reason,
isn’t it?”
“It’s been like . . . like something out of someone else’s life, these last
few weeks with you,” said Harry. “But I can’t . . . we can’t . . . I’ve got
things to do alone now.”

She did not cry, she simply looked at him.
“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used you
as bait once, and that was just because you’re my best friend’s sister. Think
how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll know, he’ll find out.
He’ll try and get to me through you.”

“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely.
“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this was your
funeral . . . and it was my fault. . . .”
She looked away from him, over the lake.

“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I always hoped. . . .
Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people,
relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in
the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I
was a bit more — myself.”

“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to smile. “I just wish I’d
asked you sooner. We could’ve had ages . . . months . . . years maybe. . . .”
“But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world,” said Ginny, half
laughing. “Well . . . I can’t say I’m surprised. I knew this would happen in
the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort.
Maybe that’s why I like you so much.”

Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution
would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding
Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears
dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture,
Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore’s tomb, and
walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting
still, just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and
kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. . . .
“Harry!”

He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the
bank, leaning on his walking stick.
“I’ve been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a little way
with you?”

“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again.
“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly. “I cannot
tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great
wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better
than I —”

“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly.
Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily modified his
expression to one of sorrowful understanding.
“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that you were very
close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever. The
bond between the two of you —”

“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a halt.
Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at Harry, his
expression shrewd now.
“The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night
that he died.”

“Whose word?” said Harry.
“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after
Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry
can add two and two, Harry.”

“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with Dumbledore and
what we did is my business. He didn’t want people to know.”
“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said Scrimgeour, who seemed to
be restraining his irritation with difficulty, “but Dumbledore is gone, Harry.
He’s gone.”

“He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,”
said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.
“My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from the —”
“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. But I’ve got nothing
to tell you.”

Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed to be a
tone of delicacy, “The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you
know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your
service —”

Harry laughed. “Voldemort wants to kill me himself, and Aurors won’t
stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.”
“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of you at
Christmas —”

“What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the world what a great
job you’re doing in exchange for —”
“— for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped Scrimgeour.
Harry considered him for a moment.
“Released Stan Shunpike yet?”
Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle
Vernon.

“I see you are —”
“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said Harry. “That’s right.”
Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped
away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the
Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing
Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were
hurrying toward Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction.
Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which
they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in
happier times.

“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered.
“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. “Wanted me to give
him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster
boy.”

Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to
Hermione, “Look, let me go back and hit Percy!”
“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm.
“It’ll make me feel better!”

Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as
she looked up at the castle.
“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” she said softly.
“How can Hogwarts close?”
“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more danger here than we
are at home, are we? Everywhere’s the same now. I’d even say Hogwarts is
safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d’you reckon,
Harry?”

“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said Harry.
Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were going to
say that. But then what will you do?”
“I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumbledore
wanted me to,” said Harry. “But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone
for good.”

“But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?”
“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry muttered. He had
had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore’s death. “For
me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I
can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.”
“And then what?” said Ron.

“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?” said
Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore’s white tomb, reflected in the water on
the other side of the lake. “That’s what he wanted me to do, that’s why he
told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — and I’m sure he was —
there are still four of them out there. I’ve got to find them and destroy them,
and then I’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s soul, the bit
that’s still in his body, and I’m the one who’s going to kill him. And if I
meet Severus Snape along the way,” he added, “so much the better for me,
so much the worse for him.”

There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the
stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he
cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.
“We’ll be there, Harry,” said Ron.
“What?”

“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And then we’ll go with you
wherever you’re going.”
“No —” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant
them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey
alone.
“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there was time
to turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?”
“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But mate, you’re going
to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything
else, even Godric’s Hollow.”
“Why?”

“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?”
Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a
wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally.

His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of
everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead
for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must
come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the
thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with
Ron and Hermione.


CHAPTER ONE

THE DARK LORD ASCENDING

he two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow,
moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at
each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands
beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.
“News?” asked the taller of the two.

“The best,” replied Severus Snape.
The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the
right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped
around their ankles as they marched.

“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and
out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. “It
was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You
sound confident that your reception will be good?”

Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide
driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running
off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates
barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised
their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the
dark metal were smoke.

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There was a
rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it
over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing
more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the
hedge.

“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks .  .  .” Yaxley thrust his
wand back under his cloak with a snort.
A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the
straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows.
Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing.
Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the
front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had
visibly opened it.

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a
magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the palefaced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past.
The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room,
hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate
table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the
walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble
mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for
a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of
light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an
apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table,
revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the
mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the
people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a
pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to
prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.

“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. “You
are very nearly late.”

The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was
difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette.
As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless,
snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were
vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.
“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate
right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.”

The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table
followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.
“So?”

“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from
his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”
The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others
fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.

“Saturday  .  .  . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened
upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers
looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by
the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into
Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort’s lipless mouth
curved into something like a smile.

“Good. Very good. And this information comes —”
“— from the source we discussed,” said Snape.
“My Lord.”

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and
Snape. All faces turned to him.
“My Lord, I have heard differently.”

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, “Dawlish,
the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night
before the boy turns seventeen.”
Snape was smiling.

“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it.
No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not
be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.”

“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said Yaxley.
“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape. “I assure
you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of
Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.”
“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sitting a
short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here
and there along the table.

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body
revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors
will be used to transfer the boy —”

Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once,
watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.
“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”

“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, according to
the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry
together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once
he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next
Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough
of the enchantments to break through the rest.”

“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting
strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?”
Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.
“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — with difficulty, and
after great effort — succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius
Thicknesse.”

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor,
Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.
“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man.
Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed
attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”

“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact
not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other
Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a highranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can
all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.”

“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has
converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains unlikely that
the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy
at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.”

“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed
determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several
people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter
Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”
“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form of
transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust
everything to do with the place.”

“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the open.
Easier to take, by far.”

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on,
“I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes
where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That
Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.”

The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each
of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for
Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be
speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the
unconscious body above him.

“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance,
those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I
understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”

At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a
terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table
looked downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below
their feet.

“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone,
and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, “have I not
spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?”

“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had
been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be
unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room,
leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.
“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces
of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to
borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.”
The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have
announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.

“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see no reason
for you to have a wand anymore.”
Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the
firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his
voice was hoarse.

“My Lord?”
“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”
“I . . .”

Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead,
quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but
beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch,
Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to
Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.
“What is it?”

“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.
“And the core?”
“Dragon — dragon heartstring.”
“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the
lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a
second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort’s wand in exchange for
his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened
maliciously.

“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”
Some of the throng sniggered.
“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I
have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late.  .  .  .
What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?”
“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!”
“Such lies, Lucius . . .”

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped
moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing
grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor
beneath the table.

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its
neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for
pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin
fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my
rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many
years?”

“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped
sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing
up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away
again, terrified to make eye contact.

“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s
house. There can be no higher pleasure.”

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and
heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa
sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words
could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.

“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one
side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from
you.”

Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.
“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”
“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event that, I hear,
has taken place in your family this week?”

She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.
“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”

“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.
She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.”
There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many
leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with
their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide
and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were
they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently
flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.

“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of
mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she
married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor
any beast she marries.”

“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was
quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you babysit the
cubs?”

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who
was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s eye. She shook
her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the
opposite wall.

“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. “Enough.”
And the laughter died at once.

“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he
said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring. “You must prune
yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten
the health of the rest.”

“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of
gratitude again. “At the first chance!”

“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the
world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the
true blood remain. . . .”

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly
revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The
figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible
bonds.

“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort.
Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters
were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given
permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the
woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus! Help me!”

“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.
“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his
wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had
woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.

“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For those
of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage
who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad,
hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.

“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all
about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from us . . . .”
One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to
face Snape again.

“Severus . . . please . . . please . . .”
“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand, and
Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting and polluting
the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an
impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says,
must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of
the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable
circumstance.  .  .  . She would have us all mate with Muggles  .  .  . or, no
doubt, werewolves. . . .”

Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and
contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage
revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair.
Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from
him again.
“Avada Kedavra.”

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity
fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and
creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell
out of his onto the floor.

“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and
slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.


CHAPTER TWO

IN MEMORIAM

arry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing
under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a
crunch of breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been
sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.

“What the — ?”
He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was
deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby trap.
Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup
together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin
just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the
bathroom to run his finger under the tap.

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days
left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that
this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned
how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it — particularly in
light of his immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his magical
education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used
a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before
returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for
the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the
intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three
quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of
general debris at the bottom — old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single
socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand
into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right
hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the
trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old
badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and
POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket
inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered
the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a
two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather,
Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the
trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift
except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like
glittering grit.

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself,
seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he
placed the fragment on top of that morning’s Daily Prophet, which lay
unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter
memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken
mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless
items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would
need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron,
parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be
left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn
them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some
dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit,
certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of
letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front
pocket were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B.
inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was
valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because of what it
had cost to attain it.

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his
snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet
Drive this summer.

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig
made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing
them onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else faking;
she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed
out of her cage at the moment.

As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down,
searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he
had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had
been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage,
the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to
page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been
looking for.

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED
by Elphias Doge
I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first
day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly
due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I
had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at
school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage
and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part,
Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted
notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been
convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young
Muggles.

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in
Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked
up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be
guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business,
though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were
disposed to praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a
Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody
who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest antiMuggle tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights
gained him many enemies in subsequent years.

In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun to
eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never
again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or
less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us
who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not
to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always
generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that
his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was
soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names
of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist;
Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the
magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into
learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in
Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career
seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was
when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often
predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job,
however, he never had Ministerial ambitions.

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus’s brother,
Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never
bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling
rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to
suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed
along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness
to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus’s shadow cannot
have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually
outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot
have been any more pleasurable as a brother.

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the thentraditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign
wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy
intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother, Kendra, died,
leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I
postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s
funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a
younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there
could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.

That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote
to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey,
from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of
the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life,
which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard.
Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard,
toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another tragedy had struck
the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow,
coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on
both of her brothers. All those closest to Albus — and I count myself
one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana’s death, and Albus’s
feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was
guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore.

I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much
older person’s suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and
much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had
led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an
estrangement. (In time this would lift — in later years they
reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.)
However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and
his friends learned not to mention them.

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years.
Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding
knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s
blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he
displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the
Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that
between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed
it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these
two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore’s triumph, and its
consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point
in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute
of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find
something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or
wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great
humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can
say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world’s. That
he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts
headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working
always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch
out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I
met him.

Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression,
even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense
of humiliation.

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading
this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him
at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it
was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable
and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply
odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended
Skrewt.

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it
would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common
knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with
Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had
been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had
always discussed Harry, Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and
it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous
and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he
had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only
personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one
he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”

“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the
Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of
Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he
threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the
room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today’s
Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken
mirror.

Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s
Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the
headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early
that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about
Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to
suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw
what he had missed.

Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a
picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:
DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST?

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered
by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the
popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals
the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the
guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man
tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster?

WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the
Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?
The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the
explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by
Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13,
inside.

Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was
topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing
jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what
was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him.
Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on.

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her
famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the
hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a
cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a
steaming vat of freshest gossip.

“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says
Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure my book will be the first of
very, very many.”

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page
book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious
death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.
“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as I have, working to a
deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was
clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that
need.”

I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge,
Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus
Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate
Frog card.”

Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.
“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back
about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think
we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to
watch out for trout.”

And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed
in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have
been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and
extraordinary life?

“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the
knuckles, “you know as well as I do how much information can be
generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’ and
a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt
on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful,
you know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy
Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I’ve had access to a
source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never
spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the
most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.”

The advance publicity for Skeeter’s biography has certainly
suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe
Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest
surprises she uncovered, I ask?

“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all the highlights
before anybody’s bought the book!” laughs Skeeter. “But I can
promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his
beard is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody hearing
him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled
in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his
later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t exactly broad-minded
when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely
murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so
hard to keep hushed up.”

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s brother,
Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic
caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago.

“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,” laughs Skeeter.
“No, no, I’m talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness
for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming
father — Dumbledore couldn’t keep either of them quiet anyway, they
were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it’s the mother and the
sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest
of nastiness — but, as I say, you’ll have to wait for chapters nine to
twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore
never talked about how his nose got broken.”

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance
that led to Dumbledore’s many magical discoveries?
“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many now question
whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed
achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he
had already discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when Dumbledore
‘borrowed’ his papers.”

But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s achievements cannot,
I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald?
“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter with
a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over
Dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a
bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All
I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of
legend. After they’ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude
that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end
of his wand and came quietly!”

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so
we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her
readers more than any other.

“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an entire chapter
to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship. It’s been called
unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book
for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an
unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really
in the boy’s best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open
secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.”

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she
so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which
Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had
returned.

“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?

“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the
scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter
later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has
a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the
Wizarding community to decide — once they’ve read my book.”

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that
Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore’s legions of
admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge
about their hero.

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at
the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the
newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the
rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin.

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and
picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious
of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article echoed in his
head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter–Dumbledore relationship . . .
It’s been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . He dabbled in the Dark Arts
himself in his youth . . . I’ve had access to a source most journalists would
swap their wands for . . .

“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door
neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously.
Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away
from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking,
thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming
him. . . .

A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the
jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He
glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt
Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.
He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own
bright green eye looking back at him.

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because
he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was
that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him
again.


CHAPTER THREE

THE DURSLEYS DEPARTING

he sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice
yelled, “Oi! You!”

Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his
uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was
still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had
thought he saw Dumbledore’s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed,
“BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door,
pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things
he would be taking with him.

“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at
the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he
reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for
traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat
salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in
his leather jacket.

“Yes?” asked Harry.
“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. “Please!”
added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his
throat.
Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to
pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with
anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled with
concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.
“I’ve changed my mind,” he said.

“What a surprise,” said Harry.
“Don’t you take that tone —” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but
Vernon Dursley waved her down.
“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy
little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put,
we’re not going anywhere.”

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and
amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four
hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car
with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when
Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case
since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into
the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up
and down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger.
From — from —”

“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in
front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I
believe it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”

“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before
we know it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?
Are you actually as stupid as you look?”

“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved
her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to
the danger he had spotted.

“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a house, my
godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy
memories?”

There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with
this argument.
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this
Lord Thing —”

“— Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this
about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told
you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley —”

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that
his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit,
a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The
arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had
come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit,
however, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room,
his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
“— Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on
remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me
safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure
Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I
am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue
you.”

Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant
they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on
and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to
help. You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.”
Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside
the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbor’s lawn
mower stalled again.

“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley
abruptly.
“There is,” said Harry, surprised.
“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent
victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to
qualify for government protection!”

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his
uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he
despised and mistrusted.
“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. “We
think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”

Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that
his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.
“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All right, let’s
say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why
we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”

Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had
also been addressed half a dozen times.
“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley is protecting
the Mug — I mean, your Prime Minister.”

“Exactly — he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank
television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking
along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital.
This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a
Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep
voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had
certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had
never seen him with his earring in.

“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are
more than up to the job —”
“If we’d even seen CVs  .  .  .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost
patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the
TV set himself.

“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and
derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the
news. People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — Voldemort.
I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the
fogs — they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they
are, ask your son!”

Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and
Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There
are . . . more of them?”

“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?
Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time,
seeing as they feed off fear and despair —”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your point
—”

“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them —
Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi — which means dead bodies
enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly
attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I
think you’ll agree you need help.”

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing
down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening
years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at
Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work? What
about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of
layabout wizards —”

“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and kill you
like they did my parents!”
“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these Order
people.”
“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking
sense.”

He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to
accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be
no question of being separated from their Diddykins. Harry glanced at the
carriage clock on the mantelpiece.

“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none of the
Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of parting — probably
forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to
contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain
awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of
sixteen years’ solid dislike?

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then
poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell
with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.
“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll be
able to fly again.”

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and
downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the
Dursleys on their own.
“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had
opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep
bow. “An honor, as ever!”

“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile
upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of you to do this . . . They’re
through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin. . . .”

“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily,
striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be
addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank
nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.

“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told
you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out
of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry does.
Due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry being still
underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we
shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe
location we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he
asked Uncle Vernon politely.

“Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!”
spluttered Uncle Vernon.
“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be utterly
bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly
under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was
visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.
“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling
indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him.
“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. There
has been a little change in the arrangements —”

“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was going
to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”
“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”
The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter
incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry
up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had
issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.

“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus,
nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “We are
attempting to time your departure from the house with your family’s
Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the moment you all head for
safety.” He turned to the Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to
go?”

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at
the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.
“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia.
She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room
while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.
“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further
explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,
“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the last
moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began
swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her
handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar,
reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.
“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.
He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I
don’t understand.”

“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at
her son.
Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.
“Why isn’t he coming with us?”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley
as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.
“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.
“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.
“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at
Harry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?”
“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.

“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on, we’re off.”
He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley
did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.
“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.
It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put
into words. After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he
said, “But where’s he going to go?”

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that
Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.
“But  .  .  . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked,
looking bewildered.

“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some of your
lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in
a hurry.”

Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did
not follow.
“Off with some of our lot?”
Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: Witches and
wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest
in the famous Harry Potter.

“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”
“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. “Don’t
these people realize what you’ve been through? What danger you are in?
The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort
movement?”

“Er — no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of space,
actually, but I’m used to —”
“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”
If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have believed it.
As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it
must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had
turned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.
“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”

Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for
expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”
“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would have
taken. . . .”

He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact
during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so
briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however,
that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not
have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless
quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express
his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided
into scarlet-faced silence.

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look
that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley
rather than Harry.

“S-so sweet, Dudders . . .” she sobbed into his massive chest. “S-such a
lovely b-boy . . . s-saying thank you . . .”
“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He only
said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”

“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’” said Harry, torn
between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to
clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.
“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the
living room door. “I thought we were on a tight schedule!”
“Yes — yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these
exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself
together. “We really must be off. Harry —”

He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his own.
“— good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world
rest upon your shoulders.”
“Oh,” said Harry, “right. Thanks.”
“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our thoughts go
with you.”

“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt
Petunia and Dudley.
“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle brightly,
waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.
Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked
toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then
Dudley held out his large, pink hand.

“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs, “did the
dementors blow a different personality into you?”
“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”
“Yeah  .  .  .” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it. “Maybe.
Take care, Big D.”

Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his
heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.
Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked
around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone
with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said,
“Well — good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him.
“Good-bye,” said Harry.

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest
feeling that she wanted to say something to him: She gave him an odd,
tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a
little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and
son.


CHAPTER FOUR

THE SEVEN POTTERS

arry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in
time to see the Dursleys’ car swinging out of the drive and off up the
road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the
backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows
burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.

Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his
unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his
ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage,
broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly
now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to
stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for
the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys
went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat:
Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed
upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked
through the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty
feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother
whom he had lost.

“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hedwig, who
was still sulking with her head under her wing. “We’ll never be here again.
Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this
doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the
dementors. . . . Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . .
And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .”
Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did
nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her
wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.

“And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door under the stairs
— “is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then — Blimey, it’s small,
I’d forgotten. . . .”
Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering
how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the
staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two.
Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true
identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such
strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember
the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams
involving flashes of green light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly
crashed the car when Harry had recounted it — a flying motorbike . . .

There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry
straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door
frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon’s choicest swear
words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring
out of the window into the back garden.
The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by
one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted.
Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting
astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around
him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases,
skeletal, black winged horses.

Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was
a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron
clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All righ’, Harry? Ready fer the
off?”
“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I wasn’t
expecting this many of you!”
“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous,
bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to
house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get undercover before we talk
you through it.”

Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering,
they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s gleaming work
surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky;
Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George,
grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kindfaced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, onelegged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose
short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined;
Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley,
bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard,
standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and
Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset
hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at
the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he
had tried to strangle the last time they had met.
“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?”
he called across the room.

“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley. “You’re
more important.”
“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing
machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.
“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.
“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”
“That’s brilliant, congrat —”

“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!” roared
Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his
sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. “As Dedalus probably told you, we
had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big
problem. He’s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the
Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the
name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you.
Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already.
What he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.
“Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the
Trace on you.”
“I don’t —”

“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that
detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry
finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell
to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the
Death Eaters.
“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn
seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius
Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and proper.”
Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.
“So what are we going to do?”

“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones
the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them:
brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”
Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give
Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions: when
you come of age, or” — Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen —
“you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going
your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you’re never
going to live together again, correct?”

Harry nodded.
“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the charm
will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choosing to break it
early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and
seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn’t
know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry:
They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is YouKnow-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just rely on him getting the date
wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in
this general area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses
every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the
place we’re going to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the
Order: my house, Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the
idea.”

“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a
gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries
of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to
use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve
secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once”
— he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward
Tonks’s parents’?”

“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us
won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters
moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair
heading for a different safe house.”
From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like
mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the
rest of the plan immediately.
“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No way!”
“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint of
complacency.

“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — !”
“— because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.
“This is different, pretending to be me —”
“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly. “Imagine if
something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.”
Harry did not smile.

“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.”
“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously there’s no
chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.”
“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic;
we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.

“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”
“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his magical eye
now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. “Everyone here’s
overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.”
Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways
to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.
“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few of your
hairs, boy, now.”

“But this is mad, there’s no need —”
“No need!” snarled Moody. “With You-Know-Who out there and half the
Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swallowed the fake
bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he’d be mad
not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They
might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm
holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place.
Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself
into seven.”

Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.
“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.”
Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.
“Now!” barked Moody.
With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head,
grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.

“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the
flask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”
Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made
contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at
once, it turned a clear, bright gold.

“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said
Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing
slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle’s potion looked
like bogies.”

“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody.
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt
Petunia’s gleaming sink.
“We’re one short,” said Lupin.
“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the
neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly
and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.
“I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus.

“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless
worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not
kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish
Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry
about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”
Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already
pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he
handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.
“Altogether, then . . .”
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them
gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: At once, their features
began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were
shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was
darkening, Hermione’s and Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their
skulls.

Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks
he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six
Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.
Fred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow — we’re
identical!”
“I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,” said Fred, examining
his reflection in the kettle.
“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t
look at me — I’m ’ideous.”

“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said
Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget the glasses,
there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed, there’s
luggage in the other sack.”

The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he
had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as
his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes,
putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them
to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off
with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than
they would have been with their own.

“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking down at
his bare chest.
“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she put on
glasses.
Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each
containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.
“Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggageladen Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be
traveling with me, by broom —”

“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.
“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody, and sure
enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued,
“Arthur and Fred —”
“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t you
even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”
“Sorry, George —”

“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really —”
“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “The other one — George or
Fred or whoever you are — you’re with Remus. Miss Delacour —”
“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of
brooms.”

Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look
that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral —”
Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry
knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a
mug tree as she waved at him.

Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a little
anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight,
see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the
sidecar.”

“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully.
“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said
Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s had plenty
of time to tell them everything about you he’s never mentioned before, so if
we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting they’ll choose one of the
Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,” he went on,
tying up the sack with the fake Potters’ clothes in it and leading the way
back to the door, “I make it three minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No
point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they
come looking. . . . Come on. . . .”

Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig’s
cage before joining the others in the dark back garden. On every side
broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up
onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid
was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on.

“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”
“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the last time
yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”
Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar.
It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of
him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and
broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his
knees. It was extremely uncomfortable.

“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry’s
discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked
slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a few tricks up its
handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.”

He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.
“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside
them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s
certainly only to be used in emergencies.”

“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want us all to
leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion’s lost.”
Everybody mounted their brooms.
“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive,
guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist.
Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the
sidecar began to vibrate.

“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in about an hour at
the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . . THREE.”
There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar
give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering
slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring
upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed
into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and
starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to
take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over
the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and
higher they climbed into the sky —

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least
thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst
of which the Order members had risen, oblivious —
Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the
motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights
above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life.
Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his
knees —

“No — HEDWIG!”
The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of
his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way
up again. A second’s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl
screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.
“No — NO!”
The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters
scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
“Hedwig — Hedwig —”

But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage.
He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He
glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green
light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he
could not tell who they were —
“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled over the
thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig’s
cage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. “Hagrid, TURN
AROUND!”

“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and he opened
the throttle.
“Stop — STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of
green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from
the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid
swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses
shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them.
Wriggling around he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his
own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they
scattered to avoid it.

“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up
just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near
the fuel gauge.
A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his
neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters
swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He vanished from
view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken
into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the
airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the
handlebars and sped up.

More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two remaining
Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with
further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of
multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the
Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening —
“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a
second button. This time a great net burst from the bike’s exhaust, but the
Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the
companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up.
He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were
pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.

“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him
slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.
With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust,
white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a
sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight
to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway
ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of
acceleration.

“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto his back by
the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to
twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket
pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella.
“Hagrid! No! Let me!”
“REPARO!”

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike
completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike’s
flight, then the sidecar began to lose height —
In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted,
“Wingardium Leviosa!”

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: He had
but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The
three Death Eaters were closing in.
“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry
could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he
could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled,
“Impedimenta!”

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man
was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible
barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him —
Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater
shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car,
knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat —
“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”

A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him out of the
plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged
himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself back-to-back with
Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters,
Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar,
and yelled, “Confringo!”

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the
Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his
companion fell back and vanished.
“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried ter
repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room —”

“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back, as two more
Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.
As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid
swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the
dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent
Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding
them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater
swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next
Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike —
Stan —

“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.
“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”
The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder of
the motorbike’s engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and
disappeared from view.
“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid. “Where’ve they gone?”
“I don’t know!”
But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real
one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty
darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?
He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the
back of Hagrid’s jacket.

“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!”
“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”
There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot
from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the
seat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip
on the handlebars —

“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!” yelled Hagrid.
But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked left and
right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back?
One of them had still had a wand. . . . It’s him . . . it’s the real one. . . . They
had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . .
“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted Hagrid.
Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still
seemed remote as stars.
Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared
on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters,
cast from behind —

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind,
without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out
of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again —
Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical
dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random
into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one
of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the
motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control —
Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way
was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any
second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise
its arm —
“NO!”

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death
Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out
of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick —
Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard
Voldemort scream, “Mine!”

It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed
another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, “Avada —”
As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its
own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a
spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a
scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed,
“No!”: Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire
button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more
flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground.

“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. “Hagrid —
Accio Hagrid!”

The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the
handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and
nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it.
Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your
wand!”

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into
the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw:
Voldemort preparing to curse him once more —
And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid
spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to
avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, groundtrembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.


CHAPTER FIVE

FALLEN WARRIOR

Hagrid?”
Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and
leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as
he tried to stand. He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and
expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot
and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out
of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that
was Hagrid.

“Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me —”
But the dark mass did not stir.
“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”
Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted,
“They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”
Harry’s head was swimming.

“Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.
The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like
cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing
tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.
“Hagrid?”

He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar,
lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away,
wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry
anxiously.

“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now. How
are you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and
your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s father.”
Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt
sick and giddy.

“Voldemort —”
“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder and
pushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty crash you just
had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur
Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?”
“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death Eaters,
loads of them — we were chased —”

“Death Eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death Eaters? I
thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I thought —”
“They knew,” said Harry.
Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to
the sky above.

“Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They
shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any
direction.”

Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the
point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order’s charms. He
only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a
hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate
what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble.

He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own
eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up,
however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face
covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.
“Harry!”

Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor
between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked
his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that? I
thought we were both goners.”
“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe —”
Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the
room behind Hagrid.
“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was
empty.

“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm. “It fell right
beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.”
“Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.”
As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her
sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft
brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little
haughty after Harry’s exclamation.
“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you were
ambushed; where is Nymphadora?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to anyone
else.”

She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry
at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his
fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair. . . .
“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got to get
back to the Burrow and find out — then we’ll be able to send you word, or
— or Tonks will, once she’s —”

“Dora’ll be okay, ’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she’s been
in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s through here,” he
added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take
it.”

“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his
shoulders. “I —”
He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in
which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words
occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere.
“I’ll tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she  .  .  . Thanks for
patching us up, thanks for everything. I —”

He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short
hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid
hitting his head on the door lintel.
“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”
Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the
dressing table.

“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave.
“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s
Hedwig?”

“She . . . she got hit,” said Harry.
The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears
stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the
magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.
Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.
“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great old life —”
“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue,
and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.

With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had
dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning
uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled
away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed onto hard ground
and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard
screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up,
swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps
by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered
laboriously to his feet.

“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?”
cried Mrs. Weasley.
“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted.
The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face.
“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told her. “We were
surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was tonight — I don’t
know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we
could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us —”
He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to
understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but —
“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a hug he did
not feel he deserved.

“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little shakily.
“Fer medicinal purposes?”
She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward
the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned
to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.

“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their
Portkey, it came back without them,” she said, pointing at a rusty oil can
lying on the ground nearby. “And that one,” she pointed at an ancient
sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be
second. You and Hagrid were third and,” she checked her watch, “if they
made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.”

Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed
to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.
“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.
A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter,
and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew
immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting
George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.

Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and Lupin
carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room,
where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George’s head,
Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was
missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly
scarlet blood.

No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry
by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen,
where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.
“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!”
Lupin ignored him.

“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my
office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake. “Answer me!”
“A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?”
Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.
“Wha’ was tha’ about?” roared Hagrid.
“I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve been
betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only
people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You
might have been an impostor.”

“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit
through the door.
“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice
Potion is designed for human use only.”
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving
tonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it
of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he
didn’t know which one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan
he’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?
How did you escape?”

Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed
to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how
they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and
Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of
panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who
was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of
— well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be
Imperiused!”

Lupin looked aghast.
“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture
and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”
“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him
and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!
Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army
how to Disarm.

“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very
unusual move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in
front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion
was close to suicidal!”

“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most
people! — would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a
useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature
move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.

“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said
Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him.
Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.
“Will George be okay?”
All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.
“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it’s
been cursed off —”

There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry
leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.
Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he
realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and
Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung herself into
Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them.
Over Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at
Lupin’s chest.

“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?”
“‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,’” said Lupin calmly.
Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him, I’ve
checked!”

“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his
cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!”
“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize that
there would be seven Harrys.”
“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?”
“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”
Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.

“What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley.
“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley reeled
off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway
through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can —”
“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.”
“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t
understand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”
“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin.
“Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?”
Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh.

“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry
has hushed up. Travers’s hood fell off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to
be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where’s George?”
“He lost an ear,” said Lupin.
“Lost an — ?” repeated Hermione in a high voice.
“Snape’s work,” said Lupin.
“Snape?” shouted Harry. “You didn’t say —”

“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a
speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind, but it
was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was
losing so much blood.”

Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There
was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent,
unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr.
Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus?
“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which
he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, then
headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had
staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping
hole where George’s ear had been.

“How is he?”
Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back, not
when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much
worse. . . . He’s alive.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”
“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked.
“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry.

“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry
wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs.
Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great
crash from the kitchen.
“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back off if
you know what’s good for you!”

Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into
the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew,
Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.
“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!”

“How is he?”
Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since
Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the
back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was
seeing.

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival, George
stirred.
“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley.
George’s fingers groped for the side of his head.
“Saintlike,” he murmured.
“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terrified. “Is his mind
affected?”

“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his
brother. “You see . . . I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?”
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred’s pale face.
“Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide world of earrelated humor before you, you go for holey?”
“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “You’ll be
able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”

He looked around.
“Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.
“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. “Why aren’t Ron and
Bill huddled round my sickbed?”

“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s grin faded.
Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back
outside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice,
“Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t have a long journey;
Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.”

Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since
reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his
skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the
back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.
Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky
every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the
living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood
shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked
around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.

The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The
slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering
bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap
unscathed from its leaves —
And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward
the ground —

“It’s them!” screamed Hermione.
Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.
“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms.
His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped
dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.
“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged
him tightly.
“I thought — I thought —”

“’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “’M fine.”
“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin.
“Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and
when you’re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom —”
“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around
his neck.
“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking free.
“Are we the last back?”
“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye
and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re okay, Ron —”
She ran back inside.
“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded almost angry at
Tonks.

“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry,
Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I’d got her, I owe
Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron’s
Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us
—”
A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to
say anything else.
“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry,
Hermione, and Kingsley.
They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the
continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie
upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.
“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been
there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the
sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”

Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the
darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as
Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s boundaries.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind
them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.
“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.”
“Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once.
“How’s George?” asked Lupin.

“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron.
“He’s lost —”
But the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry:
A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill
and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.
“Bill! Thank God, thank God —”

Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was
perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.”
Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside
him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.
“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks
in the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just after we broke out
of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north
too. Voldemort — he can fly — went straight for them. Dung panicked, I
heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated.
Voldemort’s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his
broom and — there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen
of them on our own tail —”
Bill’s voice broke.

“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin.
They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend
it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be.  .  .  . Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the
consummate survivor . . .
At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there
was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where
Fred and George were laughing together.
“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered. “What’s
happened? Who’s — ?”

“Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.”
The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know
what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been
close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his protégée at the Ministry
of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had
most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.
Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of firewhisky
and some glasses.

“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses
soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft.
“Mad-Eye.”
“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank.
“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.
The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into
him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with
something that was like courage.
“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his own
glass in one.

The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching
Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of
what they might hear.
“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill, “and I wondered that too, on
the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t they?
But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there would be
seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case
you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of
skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential point? I think
Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that. He didn’t want to come in the first
place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them.
It was enough to make anyone panic.”

“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,” sniffed
Tonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest,
most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave
them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .”

“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does not
explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody
must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze
only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ’ole plan.”
She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful
face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only
sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his
handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to
save Harry’s — Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once
been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a
dragon’s egg. . . .

“No,” Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The
firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean . . . if somebody
made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip, I know they
didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated, again a little louder
than he would usually have spoken. “We’ve got to trust each other. I trust
all of you, I don’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to
Voldemort.”

More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry
felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do.
As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing
about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust people.
“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly.
“Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of
whose mouth twitched.
Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close
to pitying.

“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.
“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have regarded it
as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.”
Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed
by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to
argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side
table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether
—”

“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”
“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together.
“Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”
“Can’t it — ?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill.
“Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took it?”
Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left.
The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who
remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with
them like a presence.

“I’ve got to go too,” said Harry.
Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him.
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What are you talking
about?”
“I can’t stay here.”
He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt like this for
more than a year.

“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want —”
“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of tonight
was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur’s
agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything
so that we can all stay together and look after you —”
She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.
“If Voldemort finds out I’m here —”
“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.

“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley.
“He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re in.”
“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry.
“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “but it would make our efforts
tonight seem rather pointless if you left.”
“Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after all we
wen’ through ter get you here?”
“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting himself up on
his cushions.

“I know that —”
“Mad-Eye wouldn’t want —”
“I KNOW!” Harry bellowed.
He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know
what they had done for him, didn’t they understand that it was for precisely
that reason that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on
his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar
continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs.
Weasley.

“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with
Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.”
His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank
the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Escaped him,
fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”
“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand acted of its
own accord.”

After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible,
Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted
instinctively.”

“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a
spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold
flames appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trained —”

“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was
burning: He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all
imagining him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that
he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on
its own before.
His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled
its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the
gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his
pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.

Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would
have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted independently, because
Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had
explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand
and Voldemort’s  .  .  . But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his
parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to
them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with
firewhisky. . . .

And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his
forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.
“You told me the problem would be solved by using another’s wand!”
And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags
upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of
unendurable agony. . . .

“No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .”
“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!”
“I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .”
“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!”
“I swear I did not . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . .”
“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!”
“I cannot understand . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . between your
two wands. . . .”

“Lies!”
“Please . . . I beg you. . . .”
And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s surge
of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony —
“Harry?”
It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the
darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still
tingling. It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione
were at his side.
“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered. “You aren’t still
thinking of leaving?”

“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.
“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look into
Harry’s face. “You look awful!”
“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Ollivander. . . .”
When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked
appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.

“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar — it wasn’t supposed to
do this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection open up again —
Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!”
When he did not reply, she gripped his arm.
“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the
Wizarding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!”


CHAPTER SIX

THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS

he shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that
followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the
back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay
news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt
and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy
Horcruxes as soon as possible.

“Well, you can’t do anything about the” — Ron mouthed the word
Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace on you. And
we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,” he dropped his voice
to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats
are?”

“No,” Harry admitted.
“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She said
she was saving it for when you got here.”
They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left
for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny,
while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.
“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means I only
need to stay here four days. Then I can —”
“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the
wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”
Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.
“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.
“Don’t they realize how important — ?”

“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you
mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.”
Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was
not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.
“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off to
do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin’ve both asked as
well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us,
they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.”
Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs.
Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a
lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack.
Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.
“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out
of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”

The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what
looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.
“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,” mumbled Harry. “Ron and
Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.”
“What sort of ‘stuff’?”

“I’m sorry, I can’t —”
“Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m sure
Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been
afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced himself to look directly
into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade
of brown as Ginny’s. This did not help.

“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m sorry.
Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice —”
“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all
pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense, if
Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command!
Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you
something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you —”
“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.”
He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying,
which was patterned with golden bulrushes.

“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”
“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather
unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well, Harry,
while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with the
preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still so much to
do.”

“No — I — of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden
change of subject.
“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.
From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so
busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to
think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs.

Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the
terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning,
of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden
and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés, however, Harry
started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out
seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not
had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he
had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.

“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together
and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny told Harry in an
undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.
“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry muttered.
“Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making
vol-au-vents?”

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten.
“So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to do?”
“I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively.
They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in
Ginny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first
time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded
corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them
too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley,
and Bill walked in.

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because
the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the
headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of
Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore
had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret-Keeper in
turn.

“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of
the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death
Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t expect it to hold much
longer.”
“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?”
asked Harry.

“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns
up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and
to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can’t be sure. It
would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its
protection has become so shaky.”

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver
knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid
things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been
separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing
her arm he could barely cut his chicken.
“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill.

“Nothing,” replied Bill.
They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and
Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he
might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.
“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding
the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s keeping a lot
quiet these days.”

“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I
used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the table to Mr.
Weasley, who shook his head.

“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want me to
tell the world Voldemort attacked me?”
“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-KnowWho is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass breakout.”
“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his knife so
tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white
against his skin: I must not tell lies.

“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked Ron
angrily.
“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied, “terrified
that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked!
There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t believe the Muggle
Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn’t been seen for weeks
now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just
hope he’s working on a plan.”

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates
onto the work surface and served apple tart.
“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised, ’Arry,” said Fleur, once
everyone had pudding. “For ze wedding,” she added, when he looked
confused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot
guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.”
From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.
“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where she
sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of
jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. “Now, Ron,
have you cleaned out your room yet?”

“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his
mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine
with it the way it is!”
“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young
man —”

“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously.
“No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left —”
“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “And do
as you’re told.”

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked
the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.
“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut
across him.

“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the
chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change the sheets
for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven
tomorrow morning.”

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.
“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told Harry,
blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what
was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say, keeping — it in
here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the
most magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how
brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when
Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time.”

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen,
so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom.
“I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry
entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently
just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only
change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy
ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry
recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.

“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.
“And how did you manage to get away?”
“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets
yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto
one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.
“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon he
might have survived.”

“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry.
“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be sure
what he saw?”
“Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand
feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland
in her hand.

“He could have used a Shield Charm —”
“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry.
“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily,
punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.
“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking
shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!”
For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, broken as
Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket.
He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.
“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no
one’s found him,” said Ron wisely.

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in
Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him
—”

“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to
see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s Syllabary.
“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed.
“Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —”
But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed
and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket
and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out
the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and
said, “Tergeo.”

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with
himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.
“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . .” She blew her nose and hiccuped.
“It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never
imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!”
“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know what
he’d say to us if he was here?”

“‘C-constant vigilance,’” said Hermione, mopping her eyes.
“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from what
happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little
squit, Mundungus.”

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more
books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her
shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The
book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at
Ron’s ankle.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from
Ron’s leg and retied it shut.
“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked, limping
back to his bed.

“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione.
“When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”
“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot
we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”
“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I
wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d
better take it, to be safe.”

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up
Hogwarts: A History.
“Listen,” said Harry.
He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar
mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come
with me,” Harry began.

“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.
“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You
know, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we’re not going back
there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with —”
“Listen!” said Harry again.
“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you. That
was decided months ago — years, really.”
“But —”

“Shut up,” Ron advised him.
“— are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.
“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the
discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for days, so
we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your information has
included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling MadEye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron’s mum’s nose.
“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re convinced
they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life’s
ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That’s to
make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate
them about me — or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit
about you.

“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad
and lift the enchantment. If I don’t — well, I think I’ve cast a good enough
charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don’t
know that they’ve got a daughter, you see.”
Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the
bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though
reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say,
not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else
tact.

“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t —”
“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if
we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.”
“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron.
“Go on, he needs to know!”
“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”
For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and
stumped over to the door.

“C’mon.”
“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny
landing.
“Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch
opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A
horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole,
along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.
“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met
the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at
him.”

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His
head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature
curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth
wide open.

“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”
“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of
pustules.”

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape
and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became used to the
darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He was also sure that
ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and
covered in angry purple blisters.

“He’s me, see?” said Ron.
“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”
“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said Ron.
They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and
rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.

“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in my
room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it — well, it’s hard
to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when
you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?”
Harry merely looked his confusion.

“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the
brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts
again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right?
Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if
they’ve got information on where you are.”
“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of
Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,” said
Hermione.

“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t all
leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story that I’m
seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back to school. If
anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul
in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s really contagious, so they’re
not going to want to go near him. It won’t matter that he can’t say anything,
either, because apparently you can’t once the fungus has spread to your
uvula.”

“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.
“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well,
you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re going till we’ve gone.”
There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione
continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her,
and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The
measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more
than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come
with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He
wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find
words important enough.

Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting
from four floors below.
“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,” said Ron.
“I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the
wedding.”

“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and
she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she pored
indecisively over Break with a Banshee.

“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said Ron.
“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive
Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An
Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re going after we
leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric’s Hollow first,
Harry, and I understand why, but  .  .  . well  .  .  . shouldn’t we make the
Horcruxes our priority?”

“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,” said
Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to
return to Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only part of the
attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held
answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had
survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge
of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened,
wanting to understand.

“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch
on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect you to go back
and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go wherever you like?”
This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a
counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of
thought.

“This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the real
locket?”
Hermione nodded.
“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”
Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux
in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.
“‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I
can,’” Harry read out.

“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron.
“Or she,” interposed Hermione.
“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”
“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t
we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.”
“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked Ron.
“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”
“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Horcruxes
in the library?”

“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who hd turned pink. “Dumbledore
removed them all, but he — he didn’t destroy them.”
Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed.
“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands
on those Horcrux books?”

“It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron
with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even if
Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t
want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to
—”

“Get to the point!” said Ron.
“Well  .  .  . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a
Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out of
Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.”
“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a
mixture of admiration and incredulity.

“Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral,” said Hermione in an even
smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for
the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it — it just
occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would
be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew
straight in through the open window and I — I packed them.”
She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dumbledore
would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the
information to make a Horcrux, is it?”
“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these books
anyway?”

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a
large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated
and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.
“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a
Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a horrible book, really awful, full
of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . .
If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the
instruction he needed from here.”

“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d
already read that?” asked Ron.
“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split
your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure Riddle already
knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I
think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the
information.”

“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more horrible
they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in
this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and
that’s just by making one Horcrux!”
Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving
beyond “usual evil.”

“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron asked.
“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be
excruciatingly painful.”

“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.
“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done.
There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see
Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?”
“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to
destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining
rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to
make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to
Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a
Horcrux.”

“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.
“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,”
said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”
“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to
be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk
venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare —”
“— phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few
substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to
carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve,
though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the
trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”
“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t the bit
of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”
Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione
hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you
through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”
“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Harry
laughed.

“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your
body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it’s the other
way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its
container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t exist without it.”
“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remembering ink
pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece
of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.

“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it
could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did,
flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.”
“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was
possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”

“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit
in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean
holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before
Ron could speak. “I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out
into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if
you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.”
“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry. “Why didn’t
I ask him? I never really . . .”

His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have
asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to
Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had
been alive, to find out more . . . to find out everything. . . .

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wallshaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art;
Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off
the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his
head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before
realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was
disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.
“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her voice
trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest  .  .  . but there are wedding
presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the
impression that you had agreed to help.”

“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet,
sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re sorry . . .”
With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the
room after Mrs. Weasley.
“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone, still
massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without the job
satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find
Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”

Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding
presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite abruptly.
The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock. Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur’s
family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs
to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they
had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny
backyard to await the visitors.

Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and
old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were
gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door
in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an
attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had
been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally
spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that
it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.

He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed
upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it
was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the
place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a
nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their
approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be
coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden
with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green
robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.

“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”
Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a
head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard.
However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on highheeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered.
“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur tells us
you ’ave been working very ’ard.”
“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trouble at
all!”

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering
out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.
“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s hand
between his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most honored at
the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife,
Apolline.”

Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too.
“Enchantée,” she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amusing
stories!”

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look,
upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression
appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.
“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said
Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with
waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling
smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her
eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.

“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the
Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After you!”s and
“Not at all!”s.

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They
were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for
the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating
plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “Charmant!” Madame Delacour was most
accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a
trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way
she could and jabbering away in rapid French.

On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many
people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room,
having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s protests and
insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in
Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man,
once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together
became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and
Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the
overcrowded house.

“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt
at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley
carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.
“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached them.
“We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to
put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained, pausing to lean against the
henhouse. She looked exhausted. “Millamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re
very good, Bill’s escorting them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re
here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all
these security spells around the place.”

“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly.
“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t mean —
well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve been wanting to
ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after
all, it’s an important day. . . .”
“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain
this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner
would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wedding. . . .”
“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And
how about Hagrid?”

“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of trouble.”
“Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . .”
She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly,
straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand
near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang
themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the
inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.


CHAPTER SEVEN

THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

e was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn.
Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the
man he sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of
little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem . . . ?
“Oi, wake up.”

Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron’s
dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy.
Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on
Harry’s forehead was prickling.
“You were muttering in your sleep.”
“Was I?”

“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’”
Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly blurred.
“Who’s Gregorovitch?”
“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.”
Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard
the name before, but he could not think where.
“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.”
“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently.

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to
remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back
was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a
deep valley.
“I think he’s abroad.”

“Who, Gregorovitch?”
“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It
didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.”
“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?”
Ron sounded worried.

“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although how she
expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . .”
He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was the name
“Gregorovitch” familiar?

“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quidditch.
There’s some connection, but I can’t — I can’t think what it is.”
“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgovitch?”
“Who?”

“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a
record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a
season.”

“No,” said Harry. “I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.”
“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.”
“Wow — that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen!”
Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the
cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, “Accio Glasses!”
Although they were only around a foot away, there was something
immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until
they poked him in the eye.

“Slick,” snorted Ron.
Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s possessions flying
around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly
around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic
(the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the
pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters
bright blue.

“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering when
Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap it up here, it’s
not for my mother’s eyes.”
“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a
departure from tradition, isn’t it?”
“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve FailSafe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about
girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of
Lavender and I would’ve known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and
George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not
all about wandwork, either.”

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on
the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while
Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan.
“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs.
Weasley, beaming at him. “He had to leave early for work, but he’ll be back
for dinner. That’s our present on top.”

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped
it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given
Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face
instead of hands.

“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,” said
Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. “I’m afraid
that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother Fabian’s and he
wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit dented on the back, but
—”

The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He
tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood
them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then
waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to
flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.

“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and
adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not much, but I hope you
like it. What did you get him?” she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear
her.

“Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron.
She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained
an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze
smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but
you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might find you
’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like.  .  .  .”), chocolates from the
Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes
merchandise from Fred and George.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of
Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably
crowded.

“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s presents
out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. “I’m nearly done,
I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash,
Ron —”

Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor
landing.
“Harry, will you come in here a moment?”
It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the
elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed
Ginny into her room.

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a
large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a
picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the
Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window,
which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played
two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a
large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s
window.

Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said, “Happy
seventeenth.”
“Yeah . . . thanks.”
She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look
back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window.
She ignored this. He could not blame her.
“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said.
“You didn’t have to get me anything.”
She disregarded this too.

“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you
wouldn’t be able to take it with you.”
He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many
wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes
thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.
She took a step closer to him.

“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by,
you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re
doing.”
“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to
be honest.”

“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered, and then
she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was
kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; she
was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her
back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair —
The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.
“Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.”

“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was
a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice,
“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.”
Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam
the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room
when the door opened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap
bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying
well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all
happy forgetfulness was gone.

He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew
what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have
succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in
front of Ron.
“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the
bedroom.

Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the
yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along
behind them looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded
on Harry.
“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?”
“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with
them.

“Ron —”
But Ron held up a hand to silence her.
“She was really cut up when you ended it —”
“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted
to.”
“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes
up again —”
“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to
— to end up married, or —”

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white
dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling
moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered,
whereas his . . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.
“If you keep groping her every chance you get —”

“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but
he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”
Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and
forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s . . .
yeah.”

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of
the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more
than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came
as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force
Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was
about to get a proper haircut.

As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s kitchen to
breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid,
several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George
bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number
17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s
ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet
used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes
about it.

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her
wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.
“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione
turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an eye
for that sort of thing.”

“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little
confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that
he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his
copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye
and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly
striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.

“Out of the way, out of the way!” sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the
gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in
front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake,
which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk
carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the
middle of the table, Harry said,
“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.”

“Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave
Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.
By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred
and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had
honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit.
Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand, Harry thought he looked
rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply
radiant.

“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly.
“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine
from Fred. “Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?”
“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash down the
front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?”
“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled. “All righ’, Ron, Hermione?”
“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?”

“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I’ll show yeh
when yeh get back —” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s gazes as
Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry — couldn’ think what ter get
yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry
drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around
the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in there an’ no one but the owner can
get it out. They’re rare, them.”

“Hagrid, thanks!”
“’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. “An’
there’s Charlie! Always liked him — hey! Charlie!”
Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new,
brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of
burns and scratches up his muscley arms.

“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?”
“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’?”
“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her
Norberta now.”

“Wha — Norbert’s a girl?”
“Oh yeah,” said Charlie.
“How can you tell?” asked Hermione.
“They’re a lot more vicious,” said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder
and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum’s
getting edgy.”

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame
Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.
“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the garden at
large after a moment or two. “He must have been held up at — oh!”
They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across
the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver
weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley’s voice.
“Minister of Magic coming with me.”

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peering in
astonishment at the place where it had vanished.
“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry — I’m sorry — I’ll
explain another time —”
He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence,
climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.
“The Minister — but why — ? I don’t understand —”
But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley
had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour,
instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the
lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer.
As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he
looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.
“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the
table. “Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.”
His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.

“Many happy returns.”
“Thanks,” said Harry.
“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also with Mr.
Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.”
“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised. “Why us?”
“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said
Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.
“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting
room, why don’t you use that?”
“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need
for you to accompany us, Arthur.”

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as
he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in
silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was:
Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were
planning to drop out of Hogwarts.

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen
and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of
soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry flicked his
wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but
cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr.
Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze
side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.
“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if
we do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and Hermione —
“can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”

“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded
vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”
Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression
that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening
hostilities this early.
“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. “I
am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore’s will.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.
“A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had
left you anything?”
“A-all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?”
“Yes, all of —”

But Harry interrupted.
“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give
us what he left us?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer.
“They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no right to do
that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly.
“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for
Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the
contents of a will —”

“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,” said
Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the
deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me
that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?”
“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?”
asked Scrimgeour.

“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good in the
world!”
Ron laughed. Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away again as
Harry spoke.
“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t think of a
pretext to keep them?”
“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione at once.
“They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re
dangerous. Right?”

“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked
Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.
“Me? Not — not really . . . It was always Harry who . . .”
Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a
stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour
looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted,
to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron’s answer.
“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the
fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few
personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions — his private
library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects — were left to
Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?”
“I . . . dunno,” said Ron. “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I
think he liked me. . . .”

“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was very
fond of you.”
This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron
and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between
them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be
listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch
much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a
scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud.

“‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are . . . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my
Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.’”
Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It
looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the
power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click.
Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it
and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned.

“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even
be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have
left you an item so rare?”
Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.
“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrimgeour
persevered. “Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three.
Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr.
Weasley?”

“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do with it?”
Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a
moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will.
“‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of
Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and
instructive.’”

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient
as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained
and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word.
She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in
runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto
the embossed symbols.

“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?”
asked Scrimgeour.
“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping
her eyes with her sleeve.
“But why that particular book?”
“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”
“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages,
with Dumbledore?”
“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “And
if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one
days, I doubt that I will.”
She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had
difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s shoulders.
Scrimgeour turned back to the will.

“‘To Harry James Potter,’” he read, and Harry’s insides contracted with
a sudden excitement, “‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch
match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and
skill.’”
As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver
wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite
sense of anticlimax.
“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.
“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to
remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and whatever it was.”
“You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?”
“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”
“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little
closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond
the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.

“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,” Scrimgeour
said to Harry. “Why is that?”
Hermione laughed derisively.
“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s way
too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from Dumbledore
hidden in the icing!”
“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but
a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know
why, I’m sure?”

Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that
answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could
not suppress the urge.
“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said.
“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione’s
Quidditch knowledge negligible.

“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before
it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an
enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it,
in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” — he held up the tiny golden
ball — “will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore,
who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have
enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.”
Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was
right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of
the Minister?

“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already know
what the Snitch contains?”
“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the
Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it,
and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practically hear her brain
whirring beside him.
“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly.

Harry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to
obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and
placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s palm.
Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired
wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to
gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might
transform in some way.

“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione
laughed.
“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the
sofa.
“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now.
“Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.”
“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling.
Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.
“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said.
Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the
ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather
pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it.
“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.

“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumbledore’s to
give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical
artifact, and as such, belongs —”
“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was the one
who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat —”
“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to
any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not make it the
exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.”
Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. “Why do
you think — ?”

“— Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry, struggling to
keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.”
“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because
Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat
the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because
he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named?”
“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword
in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that,
instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up
breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut
up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying — I was
nearly one of them — Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed
Mad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the
Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”
“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his
feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest
with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit
cigarette.

“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said,
“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?”
“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour,
breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dumbledore,
who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar
like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me
how to do my job! It’s time you learned some respect!”
“It’s time you earned it,” said Harry.

The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door
to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in.
“We — we thought we heard —” began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly
alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.
“— raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley.
Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole
he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper.
“It — it was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,” he said,
looking Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think that the
Ministry does not desire what you — what Dumbledore — desired. We
ought to be working together.”

“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?”
For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour
the scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell
lies. Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He turned away without another
word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry
heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, “He’s
gone!”

“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron,
and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them.
“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only just
released the contents of his will.”

Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects
Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone
exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and
lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but
none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have
left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the
third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s
awfully hungry, we didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner
now?”

They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of “Happy
Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was
invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in
the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring
field.

“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped
Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After everyone’s gone
to bed.”

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled
Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most
prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder’s
Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled
the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the
old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped
on the door and tiptoed inside.
“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the
stairs.

“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”
Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The
solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to
the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”

“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to
help us turn out the lights!”
“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and
examine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was
leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .”
“. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked
Ron.

“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle
the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on right under the
nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he
thought it was obvious?”

“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he was
mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch
— what the hell was that about?”

“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take it,
Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in
his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.
“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said Harry.
“Don’t you remember?”

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing
frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.
“That was the one you nearly swallowed!”
“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his
mouth to the Snitch.

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside
him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.
“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!”
He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was
quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds
before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting
handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s:
I open at the close.

He had barely read them when the words vanished again.
“‘I open at the close . . .’ What’s that supposed to mean?”
Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.
“I open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . .”
But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different
inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.
“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their
attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription. “Why did he want
Harry to have the sword?”

“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “It was
there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last
year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?”
He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he
ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and
unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with
Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had
Dumbledore expected him to understand?
“And as for this book,” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . .
I’ve never even heard of them!”

“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” said Ron
incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?”
“No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them, then?”
“Well, of course I do!”
Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book
that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused
by their surprise.

“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t
they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’  .  .  . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping
Pot’ . . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . .”
“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last one?”
“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione.
“You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty —”
“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!” said
Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard
‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —”
“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron.
“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again over
the runes.

“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear, you
know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like
in the original versions.”
“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?”
Something creaked downstairs.
“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his
hair,” said Ron nervously.
“All the same, we should get t
o bed,” whispered Hermione. “It wouldn’t
do to oversleep tomorrow.”
“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother
might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights.”
And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room.


CHAPTER  FIVE

THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX

our — ?”
“My dear old mum, yeah,” said Sirius. “We’ve been trying to get
her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on
the back of the canvas. Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up
again.”

“But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked,
bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way
down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.
“Hasn’t anyone told you? This was my parents’ house,” said Sirius. “But
I’m the last Black left, so it’s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for
headquarters — about the only useful thing I’ve been able to do.”
Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter
Sirius’s voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the stairs
and through a door leading into the basement kitchen.

It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with
rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far
end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes,
through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans
hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the
room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of the
room, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a
heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were
talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table.
Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired
man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet.
“Harry!” Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and shaking
his hand vigorously. “Good to see you!”

Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a
ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.
“Journey all right, Harry?” Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls
at once. “Mad-Eye didn’t make you come via Greenland, then?”
“He tried,” said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately
sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. “Oh no — sorry
—”

“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired
the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs.
Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a
building.

Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table
and stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms.
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of
meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from
which she started unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanesco!” and the scrolls vanished.
“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius. “You’ve met Mundungus, haven’t you?”
The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting
snore and then jerked awake.
“Some’n say m’ name?” Mundungus mumbled sleepily. “I ’gree with
Sirius . . .”

He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy,
bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled.
“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat down around him
at the table. “Harry’s arrived.”
“Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted
ginger hair. “Blimey, so ’e ’as. Yeah . . . you all right, ’arry?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and
pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it
with his wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing clouds of
greenish smoke obscured him in seconds.
“Owe you a ’pology,” grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly
cloud.

“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, “will you please
not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we’re about to
eat!”
“Ah,” said Mundungus. “Right. Sorry, Molly.”
The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his
pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.
“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a hand,” Mrs. Weasley
said to the room at large. “No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear,
you’ve had a long journey —”
“What can I do, Molly?” said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forward.
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.
“Er — no, it’s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you’ve done enough
today —”

“No, no, I want to help!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as
she hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting cutlery.
Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of
their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a
cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets,
and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and
Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at him.
“Seen old Figgy since?” he asked.

“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.”
“See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading
note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity —”
Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only
Crookshanks, Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself
once around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s lap and curled
up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still
grim-faced, to Harry.

“Had a good summer so far?”
“No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry.
For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius’s face.
“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.”
“What?” said Harry incredulously.
“Personally, I’d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly struggle for
my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you’ve had it
bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get
into a few fights. . . . I’ve been stuck inside for a month.”
“How come?” asked Harry, frowning.

“Because the Ministry of Magic’s still after me, and Voldemort will know
all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so
my big disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for the Order of the
Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.”
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which
Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius was not very
happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection
for his godfather.

“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly.
“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports, having
to take all his snide hints that he’s out there risking his life while I’m sat on
my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . asking me how the
cleaning’s going —”
“What cleaning?” asked Harry.

“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius, waving
a hand around the dismal kitchen. “No one’s lived here for ten years, not
since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he’s
gone round the twist, hasn’t cleaned anything in ages —”
“Sirius?” said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention
to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet.
“This solid silver, mate?”
“Yes,” said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. “Finest fifteenth-century
goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.”
“That’d come off, though,” muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his
cuff.

“Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley
shrieked.
Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later,
dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron
of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard,
complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew
skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end,
leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer
fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife
slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously,
exactly where Sirius’s right hand had been seconds before.
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE WAS NO
NEED — I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE
ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON’T HAVE TO WHIP
YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!”
“We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying forward
and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius, mate — didn’t
mean to —”

Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled
backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had
given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large
yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.
“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the
table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of
responsibility now you’ve come of age —”

“— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs. Weasley
raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and
spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn’t feel the need to Apparate every
few feet! Charlie didn’t Charm everything he met! Percy —”
She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her
husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.
“Let’s eat,” said Bill quickly.

“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for her
and handing it across the table.
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and
cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food.
Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, “I’ve been meaning to tell
you, there’s something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it
keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I
thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.”
“Whatever you like,” said Sirius indifferently.

“The curtains in there are full of doxies too,” Mrs. Weasley went on. “I
thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.”
“I look forward to it,” said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice,
but he was not sure that anyone else did.
Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by
transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time
with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry’s bedroom,
her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape’s, shrank to
something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of
hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime
entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting
their favorite noses.

“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .”
Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a
female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.
Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion about
goblins.

“They’re not giving anything away yet,” said Bill. “I still can’t work out
whether they believe he’s back or not. ’Course, they might prefer not to take
sides at all. Keep out of it.”
“I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr. Weasley,
shaking his head. “They’ve suffered losses too. Remember that goblin
family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?”
“I think it depends what they’re offered,” said Lupin. “And I’m not
talking about gold; if they’re offered freedoms we’ve been denying them
for centuries they’re going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck
with Ragnok, Bill?”

“He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said Bill. “He hasn’t
stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a
cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know —”
A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill’s
words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around in their
seats.

“. . .  and then,” choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, “and
then, if you’ll believe it, ’e says to me, ’e says, ‘’ere, Dung, where didja get
all them toads from? ’Cos some son of a Bludger’s gone and nicked all
mine!’ And I says, ‘Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So you’ll be
wanting some more, then?’ And if you’ll believe me, lads, the gormless
gargoyle buys all ’is own toads back orf me for twice what ’e paid in the
first place —”

“I don’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank
you very much, Mundungus,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped
forward onto the table, howling with laughter.
“Beg pardon, Molly,” said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and
winking at Harry. “But, you know, Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris in the
first place so I wasn’t really doing nothing wrong —”
“I don’t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but
you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,” said Mrs. Weasley coldly.
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George
was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at
Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble
for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.

“Molly doesn’t approve of Mundungus,” said Sirius in an undertone.
“How come he’s in the Order?” Harry said very quietly.
“He’s useful,” Sirius muttered. “Knows all the crooks — well, he would,
seeing as he’s one himself. But he’s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who
helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung
around, he hears things we don’t. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for
dinner is going too far. She hasn’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when
he was supposed to be tailing you.”

Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on
Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying
something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down his spoon in
a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his
chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose
now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from
under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer
corks for him to chase.

“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.
“Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and
turning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought the first
thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about
Voldemort.”

The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated
with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily
relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at
the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip
of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.

“I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but they said
we’re not allowed in the Order, so —”
“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.”
She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its arms,
every trace of drowsiness gone.
“Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask
questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle house for a
month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —”
“Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.

“How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily.
“We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven’t
told us a single stinking thing!” said George.
“‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’” said Fred, in a highpitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not even of
age!”

“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,” said
Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other hand —”
“It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs.
Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You haven’t
forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?”
“Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying
himself for a fight.

“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said Mrs.
Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.
Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to Mrs.
Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile
of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth
slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius.
“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,” said
Sirius. “But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there
was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right
than most to —”

“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley.
“He’s only fifteen and —”
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, “and
more than some —”
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising,
her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!”

“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you talk
about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you
might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius.
“You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!”
“Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his voice
rising.

“Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why
Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —”
“We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you
please!” said Sirius loudly.
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. “Arthur, back me
up!”

Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned
them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had
replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore knows the
position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in
to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters —”
“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask
whatever he likes!”

“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs.
Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an
ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the facts, Molly, but
the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled version from  .  .  .
others.”
His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, knew
that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge.
“Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table
for support that did not come, “well . . . I can see I’m going to be overruled.
I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting
Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry’s
best interests at heart —”

“He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.
“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?”
“He’s got me!”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it’s been rather
difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban,
hasn’t it?”

Sirius started to rise from his chair.
“Molly, you’re not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,”
said Lupin sharply. “Sirius, sit down.”
Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his
chair, his face white.

“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” Lupin continued. “He’s
old enough to decide for himself.”
“I want to know what’s been going on,” Harry said at once.
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she had
said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her
mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child.
“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. “Ginny — Ron —
Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen, now.”
There was instant uproar.

“We’re of age!” Fred and George bellowed together.
“If Harry’s allowed, why can’t I?” shouted Ron.
“Mum, I want to!” wailed Ginny.
“NO!” shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. “I
absolutely forbid —”
“Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily.
“They are of age —”
“They’re still at school —”
“But they’re legally adults now,” said Mr. Weasley in the same tired
voice.

Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.
“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —”
“Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!” said Ron
hotly. “Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes.
For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn’t tell him
a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how
he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.
“’Course I will,” Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed.
“Fine!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Fine! Ginny — BED!”

Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her
mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black’s
earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait
to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door
behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.
“Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?”
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing
him for a month.

“Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch the
Muggle news,” he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the
name, “and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny
deaths or anything —”
“That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet,” said
Sirius, “not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.”
“More than he thinks we do anyway,” said Lupin.
“How come he’s stopped killing people?” Harry asked. He knew that
Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.
“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the moment,”
said Sirius. “It would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn’t come off
quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.”
“Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied smile.
“How?” Harry asked perplexedly.

“You weren’t supposed to survive!” said Sirius. “Nobody apart from his
Death Eaters was supposed to know he’d come back. But you survived to
bear witness.”
“And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he
got back was Dumbledore,” said Lupin. “And you made sure Dumbledore
knew at once.”

“How has that helped?” Harry asked.
“Are you kidding?” said Bill incredulously. “Dumbledore was the only
one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!”
“Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix
about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius.
“So what’s the Order been doing?” said Harry, looking around at them
all.

“Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can’t carry out his
plans,” said Sirius.
“How d’you know what his plans are?” Harry asked quickly.
“Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s
shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.”
“So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?”
“Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,” said Sirius. “In the
old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wizards he’d
bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great
variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to recruit the giants;
well, they’ll be just one group he’s after. He’s certainly not going to try and
take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.”

“So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?”
“We’re doing our best,” said Lupin.
“How?”
“Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible
that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,” said
Bill. “It’s proving tricky, though.”
“Why?”

“Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks. “You saw Cornelius
Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn’t shifted his
position at all. He’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s happened.”
“But why?” said Harry desperately. “Why’s he being so stupid? If
Dumbledore —”

“Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said Mr. Weasley
with a wry smile. “Dumbledore.”
“Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks sadly.
“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry incredulously.
“Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. “You see, Fudge
thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore
wants to be Minister of Magic.”
“But Dumbledore doesn’t want —”

“Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never wanted the
Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when
Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never
quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though
Dumbledore never applied for the job.”

“Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is, a
much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was
forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. “But it seems
that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves
being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s
the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of
it.”

“How can he think that?” said Harry angrily. “How can he think
Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I’d make it all up?”
“Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like the
Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius
bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much more
comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabilize him.”
“You see the problem,” said Lupin. “While the Ministry insists there is
nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people he’s back,
especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first place. What’s
more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any
of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumor-mongering, so most of the
Wizarding community are completely unaware anything’s happened, and
that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the
Imperius Curse.”

“But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, looking around at Mr.
Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. “You’re letting people
know he’s back?”
They all smiled humorlessly.

“Well, as everyone thinks I’m a mad mass murderer and the Ministry’s
put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the
street and start handing out leaflets, can I?” said Sirius restlessly.
“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,”
said Lupin. “It’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.”
“Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started
shooting their mouths off,” said Sirius, “and it’s very important for us to
have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have
them.”

“We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,” said Mr.
Weasley. “Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the Order
of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage
— Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt
for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in
Tibet.”

“But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s back —”
Harry began.
“Who said none of us was putting the news out?” said Sirius. “Why
d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble?”
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked.

“They’re trying to discredit him,” said Lupin. “Didn’t you see the Daily
Prophet last week? They reported that he’d been voted out of the
Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he’s
getting old and losing his grip, but it’s not true, he was voted out by
Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort’s return.
They’ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot — that’s the
Wizard High Court — and they’re talking about taking away his Order of
Merlin, First Class, too.”

“But Dumbledore says he doesn’t care what they do as long as they don’t
take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,” said Bill, grinning.
“It’s no laughing matter,” said Mr. Weasley shortly. “If he carries on
defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing
we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows
Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going to go
cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, You-KnowWho will have a clear field.”
“But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound to get
out that he’s come back, isn’t it?” asked Harry desperately.

“Voldemort doesn’t march up to people’s houses and bang on their front
doors, Harry,” said Sirius. “He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He’s
well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gathering followers is
only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans too, plans he can put
into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating on them at the
moment.”

“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly.
He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks
before Sirius said, “Stuff he can only get by stealth.”
When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, “Like a weapon.
Something he didn’t have last time.”
“When he was powerful before?”

“Yes.”
“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than the
Avada Kedavra — ?”
“That’s enough.”
Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had not
noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and
she looked furious.
“I want you in bed, now. All of you,” she added, looking around at Fred,
George, Ron, and Hermione.
“You can’t boss us —” Fred began.

“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she
looked at Sirius. “You’ve given Harry plenty of information. Any more and
you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway.”
“Why not?” said Harry quickly. “I’ll join, I want to join, I want to fight
—”
“No.”

It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.
“The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,” he said. “Wizards
who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths.
“There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you . . .
I think Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said enough.”
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned
imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry,
recognizing defeat, followed suit.


CHAPTER  SIX

THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK

rs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she said as they
reached the first landing. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s
asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.”
“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade
them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. “If Ginny’s not
lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said
downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm . . .”

“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing,
pointing them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.”
“’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins.
“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking.

Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The
bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first
sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and
deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his
pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron
threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and
Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.
“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron explained as he pulled
on his maroon pajamas. “Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls
swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh yeah  .  .  . I
forgot . . .”

He crossed to the door and bolted it.
“What’re you doing that for?”
“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was here he
came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don’t want to
wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway . . .” He got
into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in
the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in
through the grimy window. “What d’you reckon?”

Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.
“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?” he
said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all they’ve
really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining Vol —”
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
“— demort ,”said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using his
name? Sirius and Lupin do.”
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” he said. “We
already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable
Ears. The only new bit was —”

Crack.
“OUCH!”
“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.”
“You two just Apparated on my knees!”
“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —”
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from
Ron’s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress descended
a few inches as George sat down near his feet.
“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly.
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry.
“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. “We
didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?”
“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
“Could be anything,” said Fred.

“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can
there?” said Ron. “What’s worse than death?”
“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once,” suggested
George.
“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said Ron
fearfully.
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said Harry. “He doesn’t
need anything more efficient than that.”
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.

“So who d’you think’s got it now?” asked George.
“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred.
“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?”
“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said Ron.
“Not necessarily,” said Fred.
“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. “Look at Ginny.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry.
“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes,
have you?”

“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!”
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and
Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later
and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was
plainly listening to see whether they were talking or not.

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again
and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.
“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been
so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for
hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs.
Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone
he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs  .  .  . In fact, manylegged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom
door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying,
“Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be studyin’ weapons this term . . .”
And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling
to face him. . . . He ducked. . . .

The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his
bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room.
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs
you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought and
she’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.”
Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted
quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first
floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled
little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long,
moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible
bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and
George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths
over their noses and mouths. Each of them was also holding a large bottle
of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.

“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron
the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid
standing on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve never seen an
infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s been doing for the last ten years
—”

Hermione’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly
saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these words.
“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —”
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to,
Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feeding
Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .”
He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine
the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking
slightly.

“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering
through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at
it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much
worse.”

“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry
quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night
before.

A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the
cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night
by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.
“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperatedly,
hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs
as Mrs. Black’s screeches echoed up through the house once more: “Stains
of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth . . .”
“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley.

Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room door; he
wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously
managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because she had
stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the
clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he
recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved me, so
she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for
Dumbledore . . .”

Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully
closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy
Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.
“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their
teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody
needed it.”

She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains,
and beckoned them all forward.
“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said. “They’ll
come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will
paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.”
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray.
“All right — squirt!”

Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy
came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring,
tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black
hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face
with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud
thunk, onto the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the
bucket.

“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. “Spray that at
once and throw it away!”
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his
forefinger and thumb.
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so
that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he pocketed
it with a wink.

“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,”
George told Harry under his breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose,
Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth,
“What are Skiving Snackboxes?”

“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a wary
eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get
you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing
them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the
orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been
rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half
—”

“‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure
activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been
devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re putting in the adverts,
anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line
of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and
adding them to his pocket. “But they still need a bit of work. At the moment
our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to
swallow the purple end.”
“Testers?”

“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies —
we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —”
“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George.
“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the
nozzle on his spray.

“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred, dropping
his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf
before returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail-order service at
the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.”
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum hasn’t
got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling
lies about you and Dumbledore.”

Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousandGalleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them
realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that
his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not
think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.
The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past
midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into
a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on
the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp
and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in
the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which
Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting
covetous looks.

“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.”
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on
either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment
of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number
of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not
understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large
opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.
“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Black’s
screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up some
sandwiches.”

She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once,
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. They
could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously
balanced cauldrons.
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all those cauldrons
for?”

“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t that
what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up
dodgy cauldrons?”
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus
heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. “Blimey, Mum
won’t like that . . .”
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently.
Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again.
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred muttered, frowning
with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon we can risk the
Extendable Ears?”

“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak upstairs and get a pair
—”
But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from
downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them
could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.

“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!”
“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a
satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs.
Weasley’s voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a nice change.”
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T GOT
ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN
CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —”
“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking his
head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of
steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go at
Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be
following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —”

Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the
portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but
before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was
completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times
too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a
quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a
bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large and rather
snoutlike.

The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though
it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward
the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all the while in a hoarse,
deep voice like a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot,
but she’s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my
Mistress’s house, oh my poor Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum
they’ve let in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame
of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old
Kreacher, what can he do . . .”

“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.
The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave a very
pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and
bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, “Nasty
little brat of a blood traitor it is.”

“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.”
“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second bow to George,
adding in a clear undertone, “and there’s its twin, unnatural little beasts they
are.”

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up,
eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they
could not hear him as he continued to mutter.

“.  .  .  and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my
Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t
know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know . . .”
“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. “Harry Potter.”
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously
than ever.

“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if
Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say —”
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in his right mind, he
doesn’t know what he’s —”

“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying,” said
Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true,
that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it
—”

“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred.
“What do you want anyway?” George asked.
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George.
“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively.
“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The
noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had
moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius,
Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his
snoutlike nose on the floor.

“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, what are you up to?”
“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the
noble house of Black —”

“— and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius.
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again, and
continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who
broke his mother’s heart —”
“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She kept
herself alive out of pure spite.”

Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then muttered
furiously, “Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother’s boots, oh my
poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how
she hated him, what a disappointment he was —”
“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time you
show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room
so we can’t throw it out.”

“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master’s
house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would never forgive
Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been in the
family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood
traitors and the brats destroy it —”
“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the
opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the
back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go
away, Kreacher.”

It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless,
the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest
loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.
“— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my poor
Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it,
her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he’s back,
they say he’s a murderer too —”
“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius irritably, and he
slammed the door shut on the elf.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I don’t
think he realizes we can hear him.”
“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from my
mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little —”
“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, “maybe —”
“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,” said Sirius
curtly. “And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he
leaves this house, see how he takes it.”

Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had been
trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though
doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread with which
it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling
family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages.
Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:

THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“TOUJOURS PUR”
“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree.
“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole
in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother blasted
me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering
the story under his breath.”
“You ran away from home?”
“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.”
“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.
“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good
about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at
your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got
a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold —
he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why — anyway, after that I
looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter’s for
Sunday lunch, though.”
“But . . . why did you . . . ?”

“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, unkempt
hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pureblood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . .
my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that’s him.”
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name REGULUS
BLACK. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of
birth.

“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as I was
constantly reminded.”
“But he died,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind
of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily.
“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?”
“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they
were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggleborns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone either, there
were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who
thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they
saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents
thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.”
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.

“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on
Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important
enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he
died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do
and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your resignation to
Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”
“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice.

She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray
loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face
and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food,
but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.
“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my greatgreat-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had  .  .  .
and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to force through
a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal  .  .  . and dear Aunt
Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when
they got too old to carry tea trays  .  .  . of course, anytime the family
produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on
here. Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s
supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said Sirius,
examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look
—”

He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names,
Bellatrix and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable
pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks,
so —”

Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly.
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the
right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked
Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from
their names led to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very
limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage
and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed. But there’s
no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood
traitors it’s the Weasleys.”

But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s burn:
Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus
Lestrange.
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his
memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn’t think
where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his
stomach.

“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him curiously.
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch,
Junior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother,
Rabastan, was with them too.”
And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside
Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories
could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood
at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her
pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction
that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.
“You never said she was your —”

“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m
concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I haven’t
seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in
to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like her?”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was just surprised, that’s
all —”

“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He turned
away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t like being
back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I never thought I’d
be stuck in this house again.”
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if forced,
when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place forever, to
return and live at number four, Privet Drive.

“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. “My father put every
security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s
Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d have
wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protection, you’d be hard
put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the
Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them
personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was
from Dumbledore . . .” Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. “If my parents
could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait
should give you some idea . . .”
He scowled for a moment, then sighed.

“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something
useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing —
as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support, what
d’you think?”

Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He
had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening;
in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, of hearing
everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius’s
words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at
Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought
how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.
“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had
been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely
something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use
magic to save your own life.”

“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back here and
live with you?”
Sirius smiled sadly.
“We’ll see.”
“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go back
to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him.
“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily.
“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley
called.

Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he
and Harry went to join the others.
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the
glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required
a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant
to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver
snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant
crusty covering like a tough brown glove.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it
lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap
powder in there.”

He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the
debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in
a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a
many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider
when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius seized it
and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding
Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling
tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak
and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy
locket that none of them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a
dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s
grandfather for “Services to the Ministry.”

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously,
throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.
Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle
things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they
caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black
crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the
room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never
heard before.

“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack.
“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught
him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.”
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only
undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which
resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing
desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be
sure what was inside it.

They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor
where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left
the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a
half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown
unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old
photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed
shrilly as the glass covering them smashed.

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they
were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good
fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing
wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more
offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish
sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed
him with a watery stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,”
before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn
Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he
is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors
and scum . . .”

At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by the
back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s
mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to
eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief
glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs.
Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house
several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never came face-to-face;
he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall,
looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too
busy to linger.

Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a
memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in
an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but
who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped
them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of
shooting heavy bolts at passersby. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in
Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes
that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.

Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about
corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing
to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was
happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or
lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the
thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his
insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he
was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud,
not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering
together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not
mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing
him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and
ordering him back to the Dursleys’  .  .  . but he would not go. He was
determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live
with Sirius.

He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs.
Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said
quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I
want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression can work
wonders.”

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked
over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth
had become so dry he could not chew.
“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound
unconcerned.

“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs.
Weasley had answered it.

“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to go
with you, and I must say I —”
“— think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips.
“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, staring at Sirius.
“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his own
eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the
eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if that were
possible, even worse.


CHAPTER  SEVEN

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

arry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments
he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of
his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses.
Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot
of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall
sniggered again.

Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast
asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the
landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the
next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students
at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of
Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.

He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door
he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it
open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there
almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except
Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt
to her feet the moment he entered.

“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the
fire.
“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly
this morning. “Sleep all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another shuddering yawn.
“Come and sit down . . .”
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge? Muffins?
Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying about
Scrimgeour?”

“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking
Kingsley and me funny questions . . .”
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of
pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like
chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing
with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the
shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.

“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomorrow, I’m
just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to
finish anyway . . .”
Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pin-striped
trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.
“How are you feeling?”
Harry shrugged.

“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In a few hours’ time
you’ll be cleared.”
Harry said nothing.
“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll be
questioning you.”
“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair, she’ll
hear you out.”
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be polite and stick to the
facts.”

Harry nodded again.
“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even underage wizards are
allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.”
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s neck; for a
moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him
again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet
comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately.
Harry shook his head.

Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be
better off there than hanging around here.”
“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his
feet.
“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for
you . . .”

Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him.
“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said.
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later then.”
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley
unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry asked him, as they set
off briskly around the square.

“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but obviously you can’t,
and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion  .  .  .
makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for . . .”
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew
it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost
deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station
they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he
found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily
business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.
“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.”

“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign.
“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them.
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry
handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle
money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train
that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept
anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the
windows.

“Four stops, Harry  .  .  . three stops left now  .  .  . two stops to go,
Harry . . .”
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train
in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator
they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way
the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with
imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic.

“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping
moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr.
Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, “Ah
yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down a side road.
“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all looks rather
different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never even
used the visitor’s entrance before.”

The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings
became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather
shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had
expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red
telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a
heavily graffittied wall. “After you, Harry.”

He opened the telephone box door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr.
Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight
fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging
crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr.
Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.

“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” Harry said.
“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above
his head and peering at the dial. “Let’s see  .  .  . six  .  .  .” he dialed the
number, “two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .”
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice
sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley’s
hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing
right beside them.

“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and
business.”
“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into
the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear,
“Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry
Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing . . .”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, please take the badge
and attach it to the front of your robes.”

There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the
metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was
a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He
pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at
the far end of the Atrium.”

The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into
the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the
glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads.
Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as
the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a
minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light
illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the
face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” said the woman’s
voice.

The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out
of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a
highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with
gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like
some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were
paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them.
Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the lefthand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of
wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.

Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger
than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was
a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air.
Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a
house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and
wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands,
the point of the centaur’s arrow, the tip of the goblin’s hat, and each of the
house-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the
pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of
witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning
looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.

They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry
workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others
battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked.
As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts
glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign
beside it read:

All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St.
Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found
himself thinking desperately.
“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream
of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the
left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A badly shaven wizard in
peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily
Prophet.

“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod,
thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s front and
back.

“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden
instrument and holding out his hand.
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass
instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish.
It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit
in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That
correct?”

“Yes,” said Harry nervously.
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small
brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at Harry.
“Thank you.”
“Hang on . . .” said the wizard slowly.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest to his
forehead.

“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the
shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of
wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the
gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind
wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around
one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood
nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.

“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.
“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box.
“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We thought it was a bogstandard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach
of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.”

With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the
golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the
rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the
lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at
his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so.
The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains
rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in
the telephone box rang out again.

“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating
the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones
Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.”

The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with
various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of
the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks,
extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The
doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman’s voice said,
“Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo
Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and
Apparation Test Center.”

Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got
out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry
stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a
pale violet color and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the
edges of their wings.

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him. “We used
to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable  .  .  . droppings all over the
desks . . .”
As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying
lamp in the lift’s ceiling.

“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation,
incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the
International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of
Wizards, British Seats.”
When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more
witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light
from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it.
“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison
Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.”
“’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left
the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet
again.

“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,
including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters,
and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.”
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a
witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was
trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the
lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the
voice said, “Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement,
including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and
Wizengamot Administration Services.”
“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of
the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the other side of
the floor.”

“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which
sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”
“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows; Magical
Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day. We had two
months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just
round here, Harry.”

They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and
emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing
with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like
miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR
HEADQUARTERS.

Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The
Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of
wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their
favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarletrobed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with his boots up
on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with
a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley
Shacklebolt.

“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. “I’ve
been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?”
“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a hurry.”
They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other,
and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley
stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very
last cubicle.

Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at him
from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the
one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — papered the walls.
The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins
were glowing like jewels.

“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of
parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on flying
Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve received
information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.”
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, “Give
him the magazine, he might find it interesting.” Then he said in normal
tones, “And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report
held our investigation up for a month.”

“If you had read my report you would know that the term is ‘firearms,’”
said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for
information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He
dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before seven, Molly’s
making meatballs.”

He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle, through a
second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along
another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor,
and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar,
revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass
plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE ARTIFACTS.

Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom
cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely
room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets
lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall
space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were
several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two
illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children’s
books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.

Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster
that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves
that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood
beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of
it.

“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off
his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve asked, but
they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn’t look as if
Perkins is in yet.”

Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while Mr.
Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had
given him.

“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The
Quibbler from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it. “Yes, he’s right,
I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what’s this now?”
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest
on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud,
“‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly
investigate immediately.’ This is getting ridiculous . . .”
“A regurgitating toilet?”

“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last
week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling
the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine.
The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they’re
called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —”
“Plumbers?”

“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we can
catch whoever’s doing it.”
“Will it be Aurors who catch them?”
“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the ordinary Magical Law
Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”
A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just
entered the room, panting.

“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at Harry. “Thank
goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for
you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve obviously missed
it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —”
“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. Weasley.
“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve
changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o’clock now and it’s down
in old Courtroom Ten —”

“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —”
Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair.
“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!”
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left
the office at a run, Harry on his heels.

“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said breathlessly as they
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as
they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at
Perkins’s desk.

“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d missed it
it would have been catastrophic!”
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at
the down button.

“Come ON!”
The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped
Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button.
“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley
angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless — but
no . . .”
A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment,
and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.
“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid
open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain.
The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful
face got in.

“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to
descend. “Don’t often see you down here . . .”
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the
balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.”
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did
not make him feel any more comfortable.

“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at that.
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they
sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were
bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set
at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but
instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left,
where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time.
“The lift doesn’t even come down this far  .  .  . why they’re doing it
there . . .”

They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor,
which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s dungeon at
Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they
passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.”
Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an
immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his
chest.

“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. “Get in there.”
“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?”
“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!”
Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam’s apple. He
swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the
courtroom.


CHAPTER  EIGHT

THE HEARING

arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had
entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had
been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore’s
Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life
imprisonment in Azkaban.

The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches
rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were
many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the
heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
“You’re late.”

“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had changed.”
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. “An owl was sent to
you this morning. Take your seat.”
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of
which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and
bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked
across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the
chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick
he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.

There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plumcolored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of
the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere
expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat,
though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the
indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, squarejawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudge’s left; she wore a
monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s right was another witch, but
she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present — finally — let us
begin. Are you ready?” he called down the row.

“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was
sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting
some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s eyes, behind his
horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his
hand.

“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a ringing
voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, “into offenses committed
under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and
the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at
number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.

“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia
Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement;
Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court
Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —”
“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,”
said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked
his neck.
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard
and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked
up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his
very crooked nose.

The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on
Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly
witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in
welcome.

A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of
Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song
gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumbledore was not
looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered
Fudge.
“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumbledore.
Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and — er — place
of the hearing had been changed, then?”
“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, due to a
lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.”
“Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I — Weasley,
could you — ?”

“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his
wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of
nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long
fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite
interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only
when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.
“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, then. So. The
charges. Yes.”

He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep
breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as follows: That he
did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his
actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of
Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggleinhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at
twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under
paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International
Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy.

“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his
parchment.
“Yes,” Harry said.
“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal
magic three years ago, did you not?”
“Yes, but —”

“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?”
said Fudge.
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while
you are under the age of seventeen?”
“Yes, but —”

“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?”
“Yes, but —”
“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?”
“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —”
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a booming
voice.

“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.
“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more
than vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a
stag, it’s always a stag.”

“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus
before now?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”

“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus
at that age . . . very impressive indeed.”

Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge in a
testy voice. “In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have
thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!”

Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was
the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.
“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, before anyone could
interrupt him again.

He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be
somehow denser than before.
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick
eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. “What do you
mean, boy?”
“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for
me and my cousin!”

“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the
Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. “Yes. Yes, I thought
we’d be hearing something like this.”
“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of great
surprise. “I don’t understand —”

“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let me explain. He’s
been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice
little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see dementors, can they,
boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s just your word and no
witnesses . . .”

“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering
from the court. “There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the
alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it
—”

“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face.
“I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very wellrehearsed story —”
Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that
alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.”
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air
out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with
the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, “We haven’t
got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this
dealt with quickly —”

“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that under
the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present
witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the Department of
Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?” he continued, addressing the
witch in the monocle.

“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.”
“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is this person?”
“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the door.
Should I — ?”

“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once,
hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and hastened past
Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked
scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change
out of her carpet slippers.

Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second
one for himself.
“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself
nervously on the very edge of her seat.
“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.
“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,”
said Mrs. Figg.

“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging
other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. “That situation has
always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.”
“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have me registered,
would you?”

“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be checking
that. You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley.
Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking left and right
along the bench where he sat.
“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.
Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. “Very well,” he said
coolly. “What is your story?”

“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of
Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,”
gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying
by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I
saw dementors running —”
“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run, they
glide.”

“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink
appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley toward what
looked like two boys.”
“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so
that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh.
“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —”
“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors  . . . describe
them.”

“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. “They
were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs.
Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever
seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth
of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches
over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise
they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a
large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a
frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and
nodded.

“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge
snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a
very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness
had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . .”
Her voice shook and died.

Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under
her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.
“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.
“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more
confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One of them had
fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was
Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he
produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with
his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin. And that . . .
that was what happened,” Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.

Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not
looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes
and said, rather aggressively, “That’s what you saw, is it?”
“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.”

Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up
and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.
“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily.
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice. “She
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I
can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren’t —”
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to
come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge. “The odds on that must be very,
very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —”

“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by
coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly.
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved
slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent.
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily.
“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.
“I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of
dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge.
“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the
Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have already
given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.”

“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe
that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors
remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.”
“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask ourselves
why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that
alleyway on the second of August.”

In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of
Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat
with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide,
slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the
little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in
mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to
the Minister,” said Fudge.

The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry
aback; he had been expecting a croak.
“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,” she
said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So silly of
me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that
the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!”

She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck
stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It
could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry
of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his
cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry
might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore politely. “Of course,
these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control —”
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped Fudge, who
had turned brick red.

Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why
two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked
without authorization.”
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not
do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle
Vernon would have been proud.
“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely expressing
my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.”
He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared
back at him, frowning slightly.

“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if
indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the subject of
this hearing!” said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry Potter’s offenses
under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!”
“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the presence of dementors in
that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that
magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as
those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of
the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the
time of the —”

“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled
Fudge.
“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are in
agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances
falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?”
“If there were dementors, which I doubt —”
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If you
still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she
would not object.”
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before
him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a
witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said
Dumbledore.

“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. “Have
you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has
come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of
magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used
three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.
“A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts
School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to give
evidence if you wish.”

“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that’s
not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge shouted,
banging his fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I
presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,”
said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school —”
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for
misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not relevant to this
inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of
coolness behind his words.
“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at school, eh? You
think so?”

“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students,
Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said
Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges
have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the
second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld,
you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws
yourself.”

“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And you
certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few
short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already
become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic!”

A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats.
Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his
right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.
“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is no law
yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for every bit of
magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense
and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your
verdict.”

Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge
glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore,
seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in
telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a
decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry’s attempt
to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire
Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.

Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an
unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the
hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a
good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have
explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over,
about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed. . . .

Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his
swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he
merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but
found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.
“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?” said Madam
Bones’s booming voice.

Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of
them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before
he could finish Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of conviction?”
Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on
his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in
the second row.

Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something
large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep
breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well,
very well . . . cleared of all charges.”

“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out
his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I must be
getting along. Good day to you all.”
And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.


CHAPTER  NINE

THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY

umbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He
remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with
his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their
feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry
stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention
except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was now gazing down at
him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye,
or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge
seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy
with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when
nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.

He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and almost
collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale
and apprehensive.

“Dumbledore didn’t say —”
“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all
charges!”

Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.
“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found you
guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —”
But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened
again. The Wizengamot were filing out.

“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to
let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”
“I think so,” said Harry quietly.

One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a
few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley, but
most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were
almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley
and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost
appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like
Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past
clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back
rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley’s mouth
tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had noticed his
third son.

“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good
news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disappeared up
the stairs to the ninth level. “I’ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in
Bethnal Green. Come on . . .”

“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grinning.
Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to
sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.

“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they mounted
the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, it’s more the
attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some
wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much deeper and
nastier, and I for one —”

Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninthlevel corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from
them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale
face.

The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too broke off
in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry’s
face.

“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something heavy.
He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood,
and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord
Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared
look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry
of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told
Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.

“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle
out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping . . .”
Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.

“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing
toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were up on the
second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle
artifacts home and bewitching them?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s
shoulder.

“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any
concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes;
Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket
of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s favorite boy, you must
not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us. . . . Shall we go up to
your office, then, Minister?”

“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. Weasley.
“This way, Lucius.”
They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not let
go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to
do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing down here?”
“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr.
Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore when
I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge again.”
“What private business have they got together anyway?”

“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the right
people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want passed . . .
Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy . . .”

The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped
around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the
doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like
Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put the
Imperius Curse on him?”

“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. Weasley. “But
Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment —
which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it
anymore just now, Harry . . .”

The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted
Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again.
They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry
remembered.

“Wait  .  .  .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his
pocket, he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid
smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and
centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at
humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping
servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione
would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his money bag
upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into
the pool at the statues’ feet.

“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with
stuff!”
“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was
now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case against you,
none at all . . .”

“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I’d
get off,” said Harry, smiling.
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and
Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He got off, he
got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was
smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”
“What?” said Sirius sharply.
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”

“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine,
then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought to know.”
“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”
“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green
waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but Kingsley
might be dropping in for dinner —”
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”

“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley, as Mr.
Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have some lunch,
you hardly ate breakfast . . .”
Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier
than they had done since he had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld
Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented
by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house
seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked
less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the
source of all the noise.

“’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way
they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing great
mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound highly
ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked to me,
though. Or even looked at me.”
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he
clapped his hand to it.
“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing.  .  .  . It happens all the time
now . . .”

None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping
themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred,
George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious, but
before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet Dumbledore turns
up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”
“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a huge
plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very busy at the
moment.”

“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one
person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly
overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very
good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry’s hand
and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier and
surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending
increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.

“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry had
confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a
moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. “You belong at
Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he attempted to
prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger, “you
wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the Order of
the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming
to live here with him.”

“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione
wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of
him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both be outcasts
together.”

“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely
shrugged.
“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius
gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.
“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said Hermione
simply.

At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.
“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard.
“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron bitterly.
“D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?”
“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can do
your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”

“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.
“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps
you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs.
Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea
to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could
do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W.,
it would raise awareness as well as funds —”
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably, but only
so Harry could hear him.

Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the
end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to
play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology
greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where
half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults
out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any
of this within earshot of Sirius.

The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have
expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the
Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes
only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure
that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable
or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to
know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig’s
owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their
bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.

“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to
Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .”
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the
bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which
swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It contained two
pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term started on the first of
September, the other telling him which books he would need for the coming
year.

“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book of
Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by
Wilbert Slinkhard.”
Crack.

Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them
doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.
“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said Fred
conversationally.

“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher,” said George.
“And about time too,” said Fred.

“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few
weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying,
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.”
“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four?”
said George.

“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a
trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. “Yeah,
I see what you mean.”
“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred.

Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very still
with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look
over his shoulder at the parchment.
Fred’s mouth fell open too.
“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?”
George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into
George’s palm.

“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.
“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron’s
grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .”
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested Harry
had tricked them in some way.
“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George
indignantly.

“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred.
“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said George
to Fred.
“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble, mate.
Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.”
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a
scathing look.

“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .”
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the prefect
badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a
moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was superimposed
on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy’s chest
on his very first day at Hogwarts.

The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks
flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.
“Did you — did you get — ?”
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek.
“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too, Harry, me
too!”
“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand. “It’s
Ron, not me.”
“It — what?”
“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said.
“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I mean
—”

She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on
his face.
“It’s my name on the letter,” he said.
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well . . .
wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”
“Unexpected,” said George, nodding.

“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . . Ron’s
done loads of . . . he’s really . . .”
The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed into
the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing around at
all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting
the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll take them over to
Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you’re packing. Ron,
I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I
can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . . what color would you like?”
“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.
“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile.

“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly.
“His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.”
Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccupation
about pajamas.
“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not . . . ?”
Ron held up his badge.
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s.

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect!
That’s everyone in the family!”
“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indignantly, as
his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.
“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful
news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step!
Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I’m just thrilled,
oh Ronnie —”

Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back
but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s neck, she was
kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his
badge.

“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip . . .” he muttered, trying to push her
away.
She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We gave
Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.”
“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not dare
believe his ears.

“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly. “How
about a nice new set of dress robes?”
“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as
though he sincerely regretted this generosity.
“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new rat, you
always liked Scabbers —”
“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.
“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new one for
a change . . .”

Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.
“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom to
buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t forget
to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither!”
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled
from the room.

Fred and George exchanged looks.
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a
falsely anxious voice.
“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George.
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them.
“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going to
put us in detention?”

“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which Fred
and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it, Hermione.”
“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pretending to
tremble, “with these two on our case . . .”
“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said George,
shaking his head.

And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.
“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through
which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the
room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, they’re only jealous!”
“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects.  .  .  . Still,” he
added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go
with Mum and choose.  .  .  . She’ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but
there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . Yeah, I think I’ll go and
tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows . . .”

He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at Hermione.
He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had
laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.

“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all,
and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.”
“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I
can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is
something they can understand —”

“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did
not belong to him. “Take her!”
He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and
pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard
the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could
hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper
basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.

He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had
gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly
at the foot of the wardrobe.
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year.
He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a
thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way toward certain
people. But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought about it . . . what
would he have expected?

Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to
himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have
expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as
Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he
really believe he was better than Ron?
No, said the small voice defiantly.
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.
I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at anything
else.

That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in
lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he,
Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started at Hogwarts,
often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in
Harry’s head.

Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight
Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that
graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . .
And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the night
he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry thought
indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them!
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t choose
prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous
situations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have
something you don’t. . . .

Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s
clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .”
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with
himself.

Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was
not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world, going to sulk
because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron’s back,
ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something?
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He stood
up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as Ron
bounded back through the door.

“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Cleansweep if
she can.”
“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”
The smile faded off Ron’s face.
“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I thought it
would be you!”
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our trunks
packed, hadn’t we?”

It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to
retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them
back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his
prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it
into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as
though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George
dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent
Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in
his trunk.

Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden with
books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron
took from her with a moan of longing.
“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want
you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron
ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom,
an ecstatic expression on his face.
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the
heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE
— NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all
holiday.

“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told Harry,
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room. “Your
father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both owls and they’re
thrilled,” she added, beaming.
Fred rolled his eyes.
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and
Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a
butterbeer.

“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as
Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask you
for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room
and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just in case it’s
something really nasty.”
“No problem, Molly . . .”

Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through
the ceiling of the kitchen.
“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in the
corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go up and get
rid of it, Molly?”

“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have your
drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually . . .” She gestured at
the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said fondly, ruffling
Ron’s hair.

“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical
eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very
uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away toward Sirius
and Lupin.

“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal
eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore
thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn’t have appointed
you . . .”

Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the
trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs.
Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had
brought Mundungus with them too; he was wearing a long overcoat that
seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it
and put it with Moody’s traveling cloak.
“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a
drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor
prefects!”

Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then
applauded.
“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as
everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food. Her hair was
tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny’s older sister.
“My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.”
“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to
smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer
and choking on it.

“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh.
“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise
some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely say that I
failed dismally.”

Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either.
All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate,
feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would
listen.

“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the
Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a decent tailwind
according to Which Broomstick?”
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf
rights.

“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn’t it?
It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they’re
superior to other creatures . . .”
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s hair.
“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it would look
much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?”
“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who
were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.

Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and
beckoned Harry closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our financial
backer.”
“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to
Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint rattling
noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.
“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”

“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his saggy,
bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m not taking a
Knut under twenty.”
“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.
“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills,”
said George.

“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.
“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re okay.”
“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.
Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.
“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll take
’em quick.”

“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied
his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled off toward the
food. “We’d better get these upstairs . . .”
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to
him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George
were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they
finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had
seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family
row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that
Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for
Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in
the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own
name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even over the
surrounding chatter.

“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley.
“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”
persisted Kingsley, “’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him
every few days . . .”
Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he
had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table, though not
remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it
had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his
nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore
a strip off it with his teeth.

“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built
vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks.
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.
“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, I don’t
want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.”
She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he
could follow her without attracting attention.
“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.
“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.

Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring
sideways at Harry.
“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said.
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old
Wizarding photograph.
“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last night
when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore
hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought people might
like to see it.”

Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at
him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.
“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The Moody
in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly less gray and
his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle
on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks
after this was taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank and Alice
Longbottom —”

Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice
Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he
had never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened to
them  .  .  . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s
Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found
bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the picture, and the little
photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were partially
obscured could move to the front.

“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his
family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks
young  .  .  . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never
found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever . . .
Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid
hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother
Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, budge along . . .”
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and those
hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.
“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him,
strange bloke  .  .  . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her
personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you go,
thought that would interest you!”

Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him,
sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once
as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to
Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.
“Eh?” said Moody.

Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently
Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.
“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er  .  .  . listen, I’ve just
remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .”
He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed;
Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” and Moody
had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door
and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to have
them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . . No one
would like that, he thought angrily. . . .

And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces  .  .  .
Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had
died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into
madness  .  .  . all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not
knowing that they were doomed.  .  .  . Well, Moody might find that
interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be
on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises.
Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
“Hello?” Harry said.

There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened the
drawing-room door.
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her
whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch
of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, no, it
couldn’t be —
But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs —
“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked.
“R-r-riddikulus!” Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand at
Ron’s body.
Crack.

Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide
open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.
“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again.
Crack.
Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of blood
running down his face.
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No  .  .  . riddikulus! Riddikulus!
RIDDIKULUS!”
Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .
“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down at his
own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —”
“What’s going on?”
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with
Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to
the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling
out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly, “Riddikulus!”
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where
it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff
of smoke.

“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a storm of
crying, her face in her hands.
“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .”
Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.
“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the head.
“Just a stupid boggart . . .”
“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .”
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pretending to
be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his
gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye had followed him all the
way out of the kitchen.

“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her
eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . . Being
silly . . .”
Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.
“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily. “Not
even able to get rid of a boggart . . .”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile.
“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again.
“Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come
through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if something dd-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? And what’s going to
happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going to look after Ron and
Ginny?”

“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last time. The
Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort’s
up to —”
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — look, I
can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but
we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order then,
you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the
Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one . . .”
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming faces. He
knew Moody was still watching him.
“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round. It’s a
matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the
whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I’m not sure
I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly.
“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur
died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let them
starve?”

Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes.
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later,
could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming
up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so
many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the
boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley’s family in
turn kept flashing before his eyes.
Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his
stomach churned horribly.
“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded again.
“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice from
the empty picture on the wall.
Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and it
seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried
about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.


CHAPTER  TEN

LUNA LOVEGOOD

arry had a troubled night’s sleep. His parents wove in and out of his
dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over Kreacher’s dead
body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wearing crowns, and yet
again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked
door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed
and talking to him.

“. . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to miss
the train . . .”
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he
dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched
their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the
result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two
flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both
screaming at the top of their voices.
“— COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS
—”

“— FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY
FATHERS —”
Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as Harry
was putting on his trainers; Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she
was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered obligingly
over and perched on top of her cage — “are you ready yet?”
“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.
“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But now Mad-Eye’s
complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here, otherwise
the guard will be one short.”

“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard?”
“You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” Hermione corrected him.
“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I thought Voldemort was supposed to be
lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from behind a
dustbin to try and do me in?”
“I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione distractedly,
looking at her watch. “But if we don’t leave soon we’re definitely going to
miss the train . . .”

“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs. Weasley
bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the
room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and
set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging his trunk.
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to
close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her
again anyway.

“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley over
the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES OF
DIRT!” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with the
luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!”
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clambered
over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, “well, on your own
head be it!”

She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak
September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door slammed
behind them and Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off instantly.
“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down the
stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the
pavement.

“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her
eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled gray
hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie.
“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking. “Better hurry up, hadn’t we,
Molly?” she added, checking her watch.
“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride, “but
Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could have got us
cars from the Ministry again  .  .  . but Fudge wouldn’t let him borrow so
much as an empty ink bottle these days.  .  .  . How Muggles can stand
traveling without magic . . .”

But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around them,
snapping at pigeons, and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn’t help laughing.
Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs. Weasley pursed
her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.
It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by foot and nothing
more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats
for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually
beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear,
then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood
belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and
their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . .
He was really going back. . . .

“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with
the luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came
limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we
were followed . . .”

Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
“No trouble?” growled Moody.
“Nothing,” said Lupin.
“I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,” said Moody. “That’s the
second time he’s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as
Mundungus.”

“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round. He
reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too, Harry. Be
careful.”

“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody, shaking
Harry’s hand too. “And don’t forget, all of you — careful what you put in
writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.”
“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, hugging Hermione and
Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.”
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started
hurrying onto the train.

“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random
and catching Harry twice. “Write  .  .  . Be good.  .  .  . If you’ve forgotten
anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry . . .”
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs and
placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved Harry
away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake act more like a dog,
Sirius!”

“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the train began to
move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The figures of
Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the
black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred
people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, and then
they turned the corner, and Sirius was gone.
“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried voice.
“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for months, poor
bloke.”

“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around
chatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,” and
he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside the
window flashed past and they swayed where they stood.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry asked Ron and
Hermione.

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
“Er,” said Ron.
“We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect
carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly.
Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely
interested in the fingernails on his left hand.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.”
“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione
quickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and
Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.”
“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, then.”
“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. “It’s
a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I mean, I’m
not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly.
“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione and
Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward
the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never
traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to save
them places.”

“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the
handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor,
peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they passed,
which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people
stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their
neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met this behavior in five
consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been
telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered
bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fellow
fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his
trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad,
Trevor.

“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I can’t find
a seat . . .”
“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past
Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. “There’s room in this one,
there’s only Loony Lovegood in here —”
Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.
“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.”
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and Neville
followed.

“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?”
The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length,
dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a
permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to
pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness.
Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for
safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer caps,
or that she was reading a magazine upside down. Her eyes ranged over
Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded.

“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her.
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in the
luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them over her
upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not seem to
need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry,
who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he had not.
“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.
“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes, it was
quite enjoyable, you know. You’re Harry Potter,” she added.
“I know I am,” said Harry.

Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.
“And I don’t know who you are.”
“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly.
“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom — Luna
Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.”
“Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said Luna in a
singsong voice.
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and
fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows
raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.
The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It was an
odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and
the next they were passing beneath ominously gray clouds.
“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville.
“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike device
Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal
memory.

“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages
ago. . . . No, look at this . . .”
He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his
schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be
a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked
like boils rather than spines.

“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly.
Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather
sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if there’s
one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor
Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I
can breed from it.”

Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life
of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defensive
mechanism — hold Trevor for me . . .”

He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag.
Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down
magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the
Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose
his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green
jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood’s
magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in
time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but
Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor,
received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get
the worst out of his eyes.

“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before.  .  .  . Didn’t realize it
would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poisonous,” he
added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.
“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?”
Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very
pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling
at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.
“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly.

“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye then.”
She closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed. Harry
slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover
him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a
joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville
and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.
“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingly. “Look, we can get rid of all this
easily.” She pulled out her wand. “Scourgify!”
The Stinksap vanished.

“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice.
Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the
food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished
their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when
the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by
Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing
a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to
him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head, and leaned back
with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning.
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said
Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. “Boy and
girl from each.”

“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still with his eyes
closed.
“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.
“’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth
and taking another.
“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione viciously.
“How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed troll . . .”
“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked.
“Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron thickly.
“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said
Hermione.

“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,” said a vague voice.
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing
unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his
mouthful of Frog.
“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised.
“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. “She doesn’t think
you treated her very well, because you wouldn’t dance with her. I don’t
think I’d have minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like dancing very
much.”

She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover with his
mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for
some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth
to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head, bemused, then checked his
watch.

“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told Harry
and Neville, “and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving. I
can’t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something . . .”
“You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!” said Hermione
sharply.

“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron
sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?”
“No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine.”
“For heaven’s sake, Ron —”
“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron
happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle’s low grunt and, screwing up his
face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I  .  .  .
must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon’s . . . backside . . .”
Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She
let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings
indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing. She
laughed so hard that her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her
legs, and onto the floor.

“That was funny!”
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at
Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now
laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously prolonged
laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and forward,
clutching her sides.

“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“Baboon’s . . . backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the
magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it. Upside
down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but Harry
now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; Harry only
recognized him because of the lime-green bowler hat. One of Fudge’s hands
was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin.
The cartoon was captioned: HOW FAR WILL FUDGE GO TO GAIN GRINGOTTS?
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.

CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:
How the Tornados Are Taking Control
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim?
“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly.
She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment he
had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley
to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler. He
found the page and turned excitedly to the article.
This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not
have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn’t been captioned. Sirius
was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out. The headline on
the article read:

SIRIUS — Black As He’s Painted?
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?
Harry had to read this sentence several times before he was convinced
that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been a singing
sensation?

For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass
murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. Black’s audacious
escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever
conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us has ever questioned
that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors.
BUT DOES HE?

Startling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black
may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azkaban.
In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black
may not even have been present at the killings.

“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is a false name,”
says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people believe to be Sirius Black is
actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group
The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck in the
ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen
years ago. I recognized him the moment I saw his picture in the paper.

Now, Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those crimes, because
on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit
dinner with me. I have written to the Minister of Magic and am
expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now.”
Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps it was
a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items. He
flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge.

Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that he had any plans
to take over the running of the Wizarding bank, Gringotts, when he
was elected Minister of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always
insisted that he wants nothing more than to “cooperate peacefully”
with the guardians of our gold.

BUT DOES HE?
Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudge’s
dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that
he will not hesitate to use force if need be.
“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a Ministry insider.
“Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, that’s what his friends call him, if
you could hear him when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always
talking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had them drowned,
he’s had them dropped off buildings, he’s had them poisoned, he’s had
them cooked in pies . . .”

Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry
found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in
pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing every few pages
he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch
League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering, and
torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon
on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and
an article on ancient runes, which at least explained why Luna had been
reading The Quibbler upside down. According to the magazine, if you
turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy’s
ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The
Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The
Hobgoblins was quite sensible.

“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer,
“The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”
“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality.
“My father’s the editor.”
“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got some
interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”
“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she
snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fifty-seven, she
turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it, just as the
compartment door opened for the third time.
Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the
sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe
and Goyle any more enjoyable.

“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.
“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” drawled Malfoy,
whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father’s. “You
see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike
you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us
alone.”

Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy’s lip curled.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he
asked.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking. “Well, just
watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case you
step out of line.”

“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up.
Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed,
Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake. Hermione slammed the
compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew at
once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said and been just
as unnerved by it.

“Chuck us another Frog,” said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing.
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He exchanged
another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of the window.
He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a
laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous.  .  .  .
Hermione had been right.  .  .  . Sirius should not have come. What if Mr.
Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he had deduced
that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was
hiding? Or had Malfoy’s use of the word “dogging” been a coincidence?

The weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and farther
north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the sun put in
a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. When darkness
fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler,
put it carefully away in her bag, and took to staring at everyone in the
compartment instead.

Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window,
trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night
and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
“We’d better change,” said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned their
prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking how it
looked in the black window.

At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up
and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets
assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to
supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry
and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.

“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, reaching out for
Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting
Hedwig’s more securely into his arms.

They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night
air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly they
moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path
down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform and looked around,
listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over here . . . firs’ years . . .”
But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female one,
was calling, “First years line up over here, please! All first years to me!”
A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the
prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch
who had taken over Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while
the previous year.

“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud.
“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but we’d better get out of the way, we’re
blocking the door.”
“Oh yeah . . .”
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform
and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through
the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been
relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been one of the things to which he
had been looking forward most. But there was no sign of him at all.
He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a
narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd. He’s just
got a cold or something. . . .

He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what they
thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of
them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be shunted forward
onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station.
Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the
students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them,
turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double
take.

The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing
between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he supposed
he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian
about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging
to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were
dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from
each wither — vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought
to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures
looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were
being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of
moving along by themselves.

“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, eager to
consult Ron about Hagrid. “Where d’you reckon —”
“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. “He’d better be
okay . . .”

A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of
cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some
timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get a coach to
themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from the crowd.
“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I’m
going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s using it
to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?”
“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is . . .”
Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming
Crookshanks.

“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. “Come on, let’s get
a carriage together before they all fill up . . .”
“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off
toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron.
“What are those things, d’you reckon?” he asked Ron, nodding at the
horrible horses as the other students surged past them.
“What things?”

“Those horse —”
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl was
twittering excitedly as usual.
“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he?”
“Er . . . yeah . . . He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, come on then,
let’s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry?”
“I was saying, what are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.

“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they
were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them
with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-toface with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then
looked back at Harry.

“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See what?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”

Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him,
gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind
them, vapor rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet unless Ron
was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was — Ron could not see
it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though
worried about him.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on . . .”
“It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished
into the coach’s dark interior. “You’re not going mad or anything. I can see
them too.”

“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the batwinged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes.
“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able to see them ever since my first day
here. They’ve always pulled the carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just as sane
as I am.”
Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after
Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.


CHAPTER SIX

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS

Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia
and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do
anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry
in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did
become a bit depressing after a while.

Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school
books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It
was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to
sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
to the wall, counting down to September the first.

On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and
uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went
down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
Dudley screamed and ran from the room.

"Er -- Uncle Vernon?"

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

"Thank you."

He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
punctures, have they?"

Harry didn't say anything.

"Where is this school, anyway?"

"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.

"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
o'clock," he read.

His aunt and uncle stared.

"Platform what?"

"Nine and three-quarters."

"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
three-quarters."

"It's on my ticket."

"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see.
You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."

"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
friendly.

"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings."

Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because
he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her
cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two
hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the
Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to
Harry, and they had set off.

They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought
this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
platforms with a nasty grin on his face.

"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it
yet, do they?"

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over
one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
in the middle, nothing at all.

"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on
earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.

He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to
get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting
desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but
the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away,
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes
left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he
was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly
lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.

Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like
tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket
inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.

At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a
few words of what they were saying.

"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four
boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like
Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so
did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.

"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was
holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "

"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go
first."

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as
the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large
crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.

"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.

"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"

"Sorry, George, dear."

"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called
after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,
he had gone -- but how had he done it?

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.

There was nothing else for it.

"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.

"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."

She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and
gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.

"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
--"

"How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.

"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the
barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared
you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a
run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."

"Er -- okay," said Harry.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very
solid.

He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer
and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control
-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --

It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet
steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him
and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,
while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
the scraping of heavy trunks.

The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad
again."

"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh.

A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.

"Give us a look, Lee, go on."

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him
shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started
to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
painfully on his foot.

"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through
the barrier.

"Yes, please," Harry panted.

"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"

With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner
of the compartment.

"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's
lightning scar.

"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you

"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.

"What?" said Harry.

"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.

"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to
his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.

"Fred? George? Are you there?"

"Coming, Mom."

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.

Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their
mother had just taken out her handkerchief.

"Ron, you've got something on your nose."

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and
began rubbing the end of his nose.

"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.

"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
twins.

"Shut up," said Ron.

"Where's Percy?" said their mother.

"He's coming now."

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his
billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge
on his chest with the letter P on it.

"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
two compartments to themselves --"

"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of
great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."

"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
other twin. "Once --"

"Or twice --"

"A minute --"

"All summer --"

"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect.

"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins.

"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.

"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl
telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"

"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."

"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."

"It's not funny. And look after Ron."

"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."

"Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already
and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.

"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.

"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who
he is?"

"Who?"

"Harry Potter!"

Harry heard the little girl's voice.

"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."

"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"

"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."

"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite
when he asked how to get onto the platform."

"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
like?"

Their mother suddenly became very stern.

"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school."

"All right, keep your hair on."

A whistle sounded.

"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the
train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
their younger sister began to cry.

"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."

"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."

"George!"

"Only joking, Mom."

The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of
excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
than what he was leaving behind.

The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
came in.

"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.
"Everywhere else is full."

Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then
looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw
he still had a black mark on his nose.

"Hey, Ron."

The twins were back.

"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
giant tarantula down there."

"Right," mumbled Ron.

"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.

"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut
behind them.

"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.

Harry nodded.

"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said
Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..."

He pointed at Harry's forehead.

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.

"So that's where You-Know-Who

"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."

"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.

"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."

"Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as
though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out
of the window again.

"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.

"Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin
who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."

"So you must know loads of magic already."

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale
boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.

"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?"

"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."

"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up
to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie
was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess
around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks
they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,
but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get
anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,
Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."

Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was
asleep.

"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy
got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff
-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."

Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he
went back to staring out of the window.

Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to
afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old
clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer
Ron up.

"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"

Ron gasped.

"What?" said Harry.

"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and
impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --"

"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I
just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to
learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that
had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."

"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and
they learn quick enough."

While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
"Anything off the cart, dears?"

Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went
out into the corridor.

He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best
Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice
Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
it onto an empty seat.

"Hungry, are you?"

"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always
forgets I don't like corned beef."

"Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --"

"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much
time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."

"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share
before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

"What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that
nothing would surprise him.

"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."

"What?"

"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about
five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a
man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and
flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.

"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.

"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks

Harry turned over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore
enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
Dumbledore's face had disappeared.

"He's gone!"

"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be
back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you
want it? You can start collecting."

Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.

"Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people
just stay put in photos."

"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!"

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and
gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than
looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep
his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but
Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was
scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say
every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the
ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-
flavored one once."

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
corner.

"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts."

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,
coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was
even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't
touch, which turned out to be pepper.

The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat
fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green
hills.

There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced
boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He
looked tearful.

"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"

When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting
away from me!"

"He'll turn up," said Harry.

"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..."

He left.

"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd
lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't
talk."

The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.

"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in
disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking
wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
end.

"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway

He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.
The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was
already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy
sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.

"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl
wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.

"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

"Er -- all right."

He cleared his throat.

"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."

He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast
asleep.

"Are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very
good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's
all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such
a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I
mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard --
I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it
will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.

She said all this very fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.

"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered.

"Harry Potter," said Harry.

"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I
got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern
Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great
Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.

"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed.

"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it
was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in?
I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's
toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there
soon."

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he
knew it was a dud."

"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry.

"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom
and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I
don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin."

"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"

"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your
oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.

"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing
something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about

Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you
get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security
vault."

Harry stared.

"Really? What happened to them?"

"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My
dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,
but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course,
everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case
You-Know-Who's behind it."

Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a
prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this
was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying.

"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.

"Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed.

"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the
world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to
with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the
money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game
when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the
toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.

"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry
Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"

"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale
boy, they looked like bodyguards.

"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly,
noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.

"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than
they can afford."

He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families
are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort. I can help you there."

He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.

"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said
coolly.

Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale
cheeks.

"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a
bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know
what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."

Both Harry and Ron stood up.

"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.

"Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because
Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.

"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food
and you still seem to have some."

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt
forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a
horrible yell.

Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk
deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung
Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off
and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they
thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd
heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.

"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the
floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.

I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at
Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-"

And so he had.

"You've met Malfoy before?"

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the
first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's
father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to
Hermione. "Can we help you with something?"

"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the
front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't
been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"

"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would
you mind leaving while we change?"

"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving
very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a
sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you
know?"

Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple
sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.
Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath
them.

A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken
to the school separately."

Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under
his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and
joined the crowd thronging the corridor.

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way
toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in
the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the
students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years
over here! All right there, Harry?"

Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'
years follow me!"

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a
steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry
thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the
boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."

There was a loud "Oooooh!"

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in
the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little
boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed
into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid,
who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the
lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at
the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer
and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.

"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they
all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain
of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried
along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the
castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they
clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.

"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the
boats as people climbed out of them.

"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at
last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak
front door.

"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle
door.


CHAPTER  TWENTY-THREE

THE YULE BALL

espite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had
been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when
term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as
fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly
less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly
too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and
George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first
couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the
place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food
anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary
Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and
Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a
mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in
future. He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.

Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale
blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next
to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid’s cabin, while the
Durmstrang ship’s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with
frost. The house-elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a
series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour
seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.

“It is too ’eavy, all zis ’Ogwarts food,” they heard her saying grumpily as
they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry,
keen not to be spotted by Fleur). “I will not fit into my dress robes!”
“Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the
entrance hall. “She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn’t she?”
“Hermione — who are you going to the ball with?” said Ron.
He kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a
response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione
merely frowned and said, “I’m not telling you, you’ll just make fun of me.”
“You’re joking, Weasley!” said Malfoy, behind them. “You’re not telling
me someone’s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?”
Harry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving
to somebody over Malfoy’s shoulder, “Hello, Professor Moody!”
Malfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for
Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.
“Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and
she, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.
“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning,
“your teeth . . .”

“What about them?” she said.
“Well, they’re different . . . I’ve just noticed. . . .”
“Of course they are — did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy
gave me?”
“No, I mean, they’re different to how they were before he put that hex on
you. . . . They’re all . . . straight and — and normal-sized.”
Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too:
It was a very different smile from the one he remembered.

“Well . . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she
held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they
normally were,” she said. “And I just . . . let her carry on a bit.” She smiled
even more widely. “Mum and Dad won’t be too pleased. I’ve been trying to
persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry
on with my braces. You know, they’re dentists, they just don’t think teeth
and magic should — look! Pigwidgeon’s back!”
Ron’s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden
banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were
pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, “Oh
look at the weeny owl! Isn’t he cute?”
“Stupid little feathery git!” Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and
snatching up Pigwidgeon. “You bring letters to the addressee! You don’t
hang around showing off!”

Pigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron’s fist. The
third-year girls all looked very shocked.
“Clear off!” Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon,
who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. “Here —
take it, Harry,” Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled
away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius’s reply off Pigwidgeon’s leg,
Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.
Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more
holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and
Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was
gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:

Dear Harry,

Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put
your name in that goblet shouldn’t be feeling too happy right
now! I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s
eyes are its weakest point — “That’s what Krum did!” Hermione
whispered — but your way was better, I’m impressed.
Don’t get complacent, though, Harry. You’ve only done one
task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more
opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you. Keep your eyes open —
particularly when the person we discussed is around — and
concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.
Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.
“He sounds exactly like Moody,” said Harry quietly, tucking the letter
away again inside his robes. “‘Constant vigilance!’ You’d think I walk
around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . .”
“But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still got two tasks to
do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working
out what it means. . . .”

“Hermione, he’s got ages!” snapped Ron. “Want a game of chess,
Harry?”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione’s face, he
said, “Come on, how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going
on? I won’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.”
“Oh I suppose not,” she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess
match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron’s, involving a
couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused
his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something
with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so
close they were almost nose to nose.

“Dobby!” Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost
fell out of bed. “Don’t do that!”
“Dobby is sorry, sir!” squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward
with his long fingers over his mouth. “Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry
Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry Potter did say
Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!”
“It’s okay,” said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his
heart rate returned to normal. “Just — just prod me or something in future,
all right, don’t bend over me like that. . . .”
Harry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses
from his bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus,
Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own
hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.

“Someone attacking you, Harry?” Seamus asked sleepily.
“No, it’s just Dobby,” Harry muttered. “Go back to sleep.”
“Nah . . . presents!” said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his
bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might
as well get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby,
who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried
that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on
top of his tea cozy.

“Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present?” he squeaked tentatively.
“’Course you can,” said Harry. “Er . . . I’ve got something for you too.”
It was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly
opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of
socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once
belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that
Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now.
He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying,
“Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . .”
But Dobby was utterly delighted.

“Socks are Dobby’s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!” he said, ripping off his
odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon’s. “I has seven now, sir.  .  .  . But
sir  .  .  .” he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their
highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, “they has
made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!”
“Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn’t spot that?” said Ron, grinning over
from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. “Tell you
what, Dobby — here you go — take these two, and you can mix them up
properly. And here’s your sweater.”
He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the
hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite
overwhelmed.

“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again,
bowing deeply to Ron. “Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is
Harry Potter’s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as
generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless —”
“They’re only socks,” said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the
ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. “Wow, Harry —” He had
just opened Harry’s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. “Cool!” He jammed it
onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.
Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be —
socks.

“Dobby is making them himself, sir!” the elf said happily. “He is buying
the wool out of his wages, sir!”
The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the
right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
“They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he
pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.

“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the
kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving goodbye to Ron and the others as he passed.
Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd
socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a
single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were
remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book
called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of
Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock
and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry’s
favorites: Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s
Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs.
Weasley’s usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of
a dragon on it — Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the
Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.

Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they
went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in
Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then
returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a
hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s
Wizarding Crackers.

They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was
untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and
Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to
watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at
five o’clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.
“What, you need three hours?” said Ron, looking at her incredulously
and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by
George, hit him hard on the side of the head. “Who’re you going with?” he
yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone
steps into the castle.
There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven
o’clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned
their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady
was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of
them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the
bottom of her picture.

“Lairy fights, that’s the one!” she giggled when they gave the password,
and she swung forward to let them inside.
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up
in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as
much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an
appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his
robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to
make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and
cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he
hadn’t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed
as the boys set off downstairs.
“I still can’t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,”
muttered Dean.

“Animal magnetism,” said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his
cuffs.
The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors
instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot
of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with
her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her
wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.
“You — er — look nice,” he said awkwardly.
“Thanks,” she said. “Padma’s going to meet you in the entrance hall,” she
added to Ron.

“Right,” said Ron, looking around. “Where’s Hermione?”
Parvati shrugged. “Shall we go down then, Harry?”
“Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred
winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.
The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around
waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown
open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were
edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her
sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.
“Hi,” said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of
bright turquoise. She didn’t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a
partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his
dress robes as she looked him up and down.
“Hi,” said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. “Oh
no . . .”

He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour
was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and
accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, Roger Davies. When
they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of
the crowd.
“Where is Hermione?” he said again.
A group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common
room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with
a high collar, which in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy
Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy’s arm.
Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored
boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to
find a partner.

The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the
Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the
front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn’t
know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the
castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights —
meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that
had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to
be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over here,
please!”

Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See you in
a minute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd
parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress
robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around
the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while
everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession
when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger
Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by
his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his
eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from
them so he wouldn’t have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl
next to Krum. His jaw dropped.

It was Hermione.
But she didn’t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with
her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an
elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a
floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently,
somehow — or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books
she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling — rather
nervously, it was true — but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was
more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t spotted
it before.

“Hi, Harry!” she said. “Hi, Parvati!”
Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn’t the
only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan club
from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing.
Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he
didn’t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however,
walked right past Hermione without looking at her.
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told
the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her.
They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and
started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where
the judges were sitting.

The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with
hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling.
The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred
smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.
Harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be
enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so
forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting
through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top
table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was
looking sulky.

Dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table,
but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron’s as he watched
Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright
purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the
students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of
black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them
politely. But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth
seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.
When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out
the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint
and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress
robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be
fined.

“I’ve been promoted,” Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from
his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of
the universe. “I’m now Mr. Crouch’s personal assistant, and I’m here
representing him.”
“Why didn’t he come?” Harry asked. He wasn’t looking forward to being
lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.
“I’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all. Hasn’t been right
since the World Cup. Hardly surprising — overwork. He’s not as young as
he was — though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as
it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and
then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of
that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he
dismissed her immediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s getting on,
he needs looking after, and I think he’s found a definite drop in his home
comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the
aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing
around — no, poor man, he’s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I’m
just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.”
Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling
Percy “Weatherby” yet, but resisted the temptation.

There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus
were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and
looked around — there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked
carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, “Pork
chops!”
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed
their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how
she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it
meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? — but for once, Hermione
didn’t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor
Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.

It now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak
before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.
“Vell, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am
thinking,” he was telling Hermione. “Ve have just four floors, and the fires
are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than
these — though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying
them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the
mountains —”
“Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn’t reach his
cold eyes, “don’t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming
friend will know exactly where to find us!”
Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Igor, all this secrecy  .  .  . one
would almost think you didn’t want visitors.”

“Well, Dumbledore,” said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to
their fullest extent, “we are all protective of our private domains, are we
not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been
entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our
school’s secrets, and right to protect them?”
“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets,
Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably. “Only this morning, for instance, I took a
wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully
proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather
magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate
more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an
eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or
it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an
exceptionally full bladder.”

Harry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could
have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.
Meanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to
Roger Davies.

“Zis is nothing,” she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling
walls of the Great Hall. “At ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we ’ave ice
sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of
course . . . zey are like ’uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place.
And ze food is seemply superb. And we ’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo
serenade us as we eat. We ’ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’alls, and eef a
poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons, ’e would be expelled like zat.”
She slapped her hand onto the table impatiently.
Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face,
and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that
Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.
“Absolutely right,” he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the
table in imitation of Fleur. “Like that. Yeah.”
Harry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff
tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top
table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame
Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.

Hermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept
calling her “Hermy-own.”
“Her-my-oh-nee,” she said slowly and clearly.
“Herm-own-ninny.”
“Close enough,” she said, catching Harry’s eye and grinning.
When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked
the students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables
zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a
raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several
guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.
The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic
applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had
been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry,
who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten
what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables
had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing
up.

“Come on!” Parvati hissed. “We’re supposed to dance!”
Harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters
struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance
floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see Seamus and
Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized
his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in
hers.

It wasn’t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly
on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of
the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the
dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention.
Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby — he could see Ginny wincing
frequently as Neville trod on her feet — and Dumbledore was waltzing with
Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat
barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so
large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with
Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.
“Nice socks, Potter,” Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye
staring through Harry’s robes.

“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said Harry,
grinning.
“He is so creepy!” Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. “I don’t
think that eye should be allowed!”
Harry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The
Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry
let go of Parvati at once.
“Let’s sit down, shall we?”
“Oh — but — this is a really good one!” Parvati said as the Weird Sisters
struck up a new song, which was much faster.
“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance
floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exuberantly that people
around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table
where Ron and Padma were sitting.
“How’s it going?” Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of
butterbeer.

Ron didn’t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were
dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot
jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled
look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry’s
other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to
dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.
“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.
“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.
“Oh never mind,” snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from
Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair. She was a bit
pink in the face from dancing.

“Hi,” said Harry. Ron didn’t say anything.
“It’s hot, isn’t it?” said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand.
“Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.”
Ron gave her a withering look. “Viktor?” he said. “Hasn’t he asked you
to call him Vicky yet?”
Hermione looked at him in surprise. “What’s up with you?” she said.
“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not going to tell you.”
Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.
“Ron, what — ?”

“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. “He’s competing against Harry!
Against Hogwarts! You — you’re —” Ron was obviously casting around
for words strong enough to describe Hermione’s crime, “fraternizing with
the enemy, that’s what you’re doing!”
Hermione’s mouth fell open.
“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment. “The enemy! Honestly —
who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was
the one who wanted his autograph? Who’s got a model of him up in their
dormitory?”

Ron chose to ignore this. “I s’pose he asked you to come with him while
you were both in the library?”
“Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing
more brightly. “So what?”
“What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?”
“No, I wasn’t! If you really want to know, he — he said he’d been
coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been
able to pluck up the courage!”
Hermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the
same color as Parvati’s robes.

“Yeah, well — that’s his story,” said Ron nastily.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows who you
hang around with. . . . He’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside
information on him — or get near enough to jinx him —”
Hermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her
voice quivered.
“For your information, he hasn’t asked me one single thing about Harry,
not one —”

Ron changed tack at the speed of light.
“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means! I
suppose you’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little
library sessions —”
“I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione, looking
outraged. “Never. How could you say something like that — I want Harry to
win the tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?”
“You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.
“This whole tournament’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign
wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione hotly.
“No it isn’t!” shouted Ron. “It’s about winning!”
People were starting to stare at them.
“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with Hermione
coming with Krum —”
But Ron ignored Harry too.
“Why don’t you go and find Vicky, he’ll be wondering where you are,”
said Ron.

“Don’t call him Vicky!”
Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor,
disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger
and satisfaction on his face.
“Are you going to ask me to dance at all?” Padma asked him.
“No,” said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.
“Fine,” snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the
Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast
that Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning
Charm.

“Vare is Herm-own-ninny?” said a voice.
Krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.
“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. “Lost her, have you?”
Krum was looking surly again.
“Vell, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,” he said, and he slouched off.
“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?”
Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely
pompous. “Excellent! That’s the whole point, you know — international
magical cooperation!”
To Harry’s displeasure, Percy now took Padma’s vacated seat. The top
table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor
Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and
Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed
through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next
song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman
kiss Professor McGonagall’s hand and make his way back through the
crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.
“What do they think they’re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?”
Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. “No respect . . .”
Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and,
spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.
“I hope my brothers weren’t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?” said Percy at
once.

“What? Oh not at all, not at all!” said Bagman. “No, they were just
telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could
advise them on the marketing. I’ve promised to put them in touch with a
couple of contacts of mine at Zonko’s Joke Shop. . . .”
Percy didn’t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet
he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got
home. Apparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even more ambitious
lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth
to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.
“How do you feel the tournament’s going, Mr. Bagman? Our
department’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire” — he
glanced at Harry — “was a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have
gone very smoothly since, don’t you think?”

“Oh yes,” Bagman said cheerfully, “it’s all been enormous fun. How’s
old Barty doing? Shame he couldn’t come.”
“Oh I’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,” said Percy
importantly, “but in the meantime, I’m more than willing to take up the
slack. Of course, it’s not all attending balls” — he laughed airily — “oh no,
I’ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence
— you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying
carpets into the country? And then we’ve been trying to persuade the
Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling. I’ve got a meeting
with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year —”
“Let’s go for a walk,” Ron muttered to Harry, “get away from Percy. . . .”

Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the table, edged
around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front
doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked
and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found
themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large
stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a
fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and
Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they
had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.
“. . . don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.”
“Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” Karkaroff’s voice
sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. “It’s been
getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned,
I can’t deny it —”

“Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly. “Flee — I will make your excuses.
I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.”
Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out
and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals
issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.
“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!” Snape snarled as a girl ran past
him. “And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!” as a boy went rushing
after her. “And what are you two doing?” he added, catching sight of Harry
and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly
discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his
goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.
“We’re walking,” Ron told Snape shortly. “Not against the law, is it?”
“Keep walking, then!” Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long
black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape.
Harry and Ron continued down the path.
“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.
“And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?” said
Harry slowly.

They had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see
the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous
people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight.
And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.
“Momen’ I saw yeh, I knew,” he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.
Harry and Ron froze. This didn’t sound like the sort of scene they ought
to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and
saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a
rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward
them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being
noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes
widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and
pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.
“What did you know, ’Agrid?” said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low
voice.

Harry definitely didn’t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate
to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) — if it had
been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly,
but that wasn’t really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a
beetle crawling along the stone reindeer’s back, but the beetle just wasn’t
interesting enough to block out Hagrid’s next words.
“I jus’ knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer
father?”

“I — I don’t know what you mean, ’Agrid. . . .”
“It was my mother,” said Hagrid quietly. “She was one o’ the las’ ones in
Britain. ’Course, I can’ remember her too well . . . she left, see. When I was
abou’ three. She wasn’ really the maternal sort. Well  .  .  . it’s not in their
natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her  .  .  . might be dead fer all I
know. . . .”

Madame Maxime didn’t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself,
took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer’s antlers,
listening. . . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.
“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’. Tiny little bloke, my dad
was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an’ put him on top o’ the
dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh.  .  .  .” Hagrid’s deep
voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring
at the silvery fountain. “Dad raised me . . . but he died, o’ course, jus’ after I
started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was
a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . .”
Hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose
heavily.

“So . . . anyway . . . enough abou’ me. What about you? Which side you
got it on?”
But Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.
“It is chilly,” she said — but whatever the weather was doing, it was
nowhere near as cold as her voice. “I think I will go in now.”
“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met another
one before!”
“Anuzzer what, precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in
the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it
was no good.

“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through
the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and
Roger fall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more insulted in my
life! ’Alf-giant? Moi? I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air
as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the
bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression.
Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the
castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. . . .”
But Ron didn’t move.

“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being half-giant?”
“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “So what?”
He knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was
once again revealing his ignorance of the Wizarding world. Brought up by
the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that
were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each
successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not
have said “So what?” upon finding out that one of their friends had a
giantess for a mother.

“I’ll explain inside,” said Ron quietly, “c’mon. . . .”
Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private
clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and
Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of
Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum.
Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.
“So?” Harry prompted Ron. “What’s the problem with giants?”
“Well, they’re . . . they’re . . .” Ron struggled for words. “. . . not very
nice,” he finished lamely.

“Who cares?” Harry said. “There’s nothing wrong with Hagrid!”
“I know there isn’t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,” Ron
said, shaking his head. “I always thought he’d got in the way of a bad
Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn’t like to
mention it. . . .”
“But what’s it matter if his mother was a giantess?” said Harry.
“Well . . . no one who knows him will care, ’cos they’ll know he’s not
dangerous,” said Ron slowly. “But . . . Harry, they’re just vicious, giants.
It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls . . . they just like
killing, everyone knows that. There aren’t any left in Britain now, though.”
“What happened to them?”

“Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed
by Aurors. There’re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide
out in mountains mostly. . . .”
“I don’t know who Maxime thinks she’s kidding,” Harry said, watching
Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges’ table, looking very somber. “If
Hagrid’s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . . . the only thing that’s got
bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.”
Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner,
neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch
Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.
When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave
them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the
entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could
have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as
far as he was concerned, the evening hadn’t been much fun.
Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night
to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very
cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking.
Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard
someone calling him.

“Hey — Harry!”
It was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the
entrance hall below.
“Yeah?” said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.
Cedric looked as though he didn’t want to say whatever it was in front of
Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the
stairs.
“Listen . . .” Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. “I owe you
one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does
yours wail when you open it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“Well . . . take a bath, okay?”
“What?”
“Take a bath, and — er — take the egg with you, and — er — just mull
things over in the hot water. It’ll help you think. . . . Trust me.”
Harry stared at him.

“Tell you what,” Cedric said, “use the prefects’ bathroom. Fourth door to
the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password’s
‘pine fresh.’ Gotta go . . . want to say good night —”
He grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely
strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing
egg meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look
like a fool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison?
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the
portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and
when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common
room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet
apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.
“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?”
yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and
her face was screwed up in anger.

“Oh yeah?” Ron yelled back. “What’s that?”
“Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a
last resort!”
Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned
on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at
Harry.
“Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just proves —
completely missed the point —”
Harry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with
Ron too much to speak his mind right now — but he somehow thought that
Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.


CHAPTER FIVE

DIAGON ALLEY

Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.

"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called
Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard."

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good
dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."

He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper
held in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon
was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it
open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
attack Hagrid's coat.

"Don't do that."

Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.

"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl

"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

"What?"

"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets."
Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of
keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...
finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.

"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.

"Knuts?"

"The little bronze ones."

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg
so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then
he flew off through the open window.

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.

"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy
all yer stuff fer school."

Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
inside him had got a puncture.

"Um -- Hagrid?"

"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he
won't pay for me to go and learn magic."

"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his
head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"

"But if their house was destroyed --"

"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I
wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."

"Wizards have banks?"

"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

"Goblins?"

"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer
anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts
business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do
important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
knows he can trust me, see.

"Got everythin'? Come on, then."

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and
the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
"Flew," said Hagrid.

"Flew?"

"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've
got yeh."

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to
imagine him flying.

"Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would
yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"

"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and
they sped off toward land.

"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.

"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter
get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never
had so many questions in his life.

"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning
the page.

"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
himself.

"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '
course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls
every morning, askin' fer advice."

"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"

"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still
witches an' wizards up an' down the country."

"Why?"

"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
problems. Nah, we're best left alone."

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
street.

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like
parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
dream up, eh?"

"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
there are dragons at Gringotts?"

"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."

"You'd like one?"

"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go."

They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five
minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he
called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and
sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.

"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.

"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need."

Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night
before, and read:

"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud.

"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.

Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know
where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an
ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.

"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
with shops.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do
was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,
hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of
ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and
broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had
cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of
humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything
Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help
trusting him.

"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a
famous place."

It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,
Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at
all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered
him inside.

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were
sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was
smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The
low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a
glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"

"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.


"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this
be --?"


The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.

"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
honor."

He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his
hand, tears in his eyes.

"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."

Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old
woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
Hagrid was beaming.

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last."

"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."

"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter."

"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
Diggle."

"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off
in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."

"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did
you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again --
Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.

A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes
was twitching.

"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
one of your teachers at Hogwarts."

"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you."

"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"

"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your
equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought.

But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It
took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard over the babble.

"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."

Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was
nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry.

"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."

"Is he always that nervous?"

"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was

studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there
was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.
Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me
umbrella?"

Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.

"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry."

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.

The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a
small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they
were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a
cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.

"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."

He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry
looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
back into solid wall.

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.

"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money
first."

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every
direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at
once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as
they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're
mad...."

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl
Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with
broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus
Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops
selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen
before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,
tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion
bottles, globes of the moon....

"Gringotts," said Hagrid.

They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other
little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a
uniform of scarlet and gold, was -

"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved
upon them:

Enter, stranger, but take heed

Of what awaits the sin of greed,

For those who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly in their turn.

So if you seek beneath our floors

A treasure that was never yours,

Thief, you have been warned, beware

Of finding more than treasure there.

"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid.

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a
vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing
coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more
goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made
for the counter.

"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money
outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."

"You have his key, Sir?"

"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as
glowing coals.

"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

"That seems to be in order."

"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in
vault seven hundred and thirteen."

The goblin read the letter carefully.

"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone
take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"

Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward
one of the doors leading off the hall.

"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
asked.

"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh
that."

Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more
marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with
flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came
hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some
difficulty -- and were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,
but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,
because Griphook wasn't steering.

Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a
passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -
they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge
stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.

I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"

"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."

He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small
door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
wall to stop his knees from trembling.

Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and
as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns
of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

"All yours," smiled Hagrid.

All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had
they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there
had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.

"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,
that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe
for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
please, and can we go more slowly?"

"One speed only," said Griphook.

They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became
colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to
try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and
pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.

Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with
one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.

"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through
the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.

"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.

"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,
Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous
jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then
he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on
the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry
longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.

"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way
back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid.

One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag
full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a
pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole
life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.

"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.

"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. "

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on
a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam
Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his
head, and began to pin it to the right length.

"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"

"Yes," said Harry.

"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then
I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why
first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting
me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.

"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.

"No," said Harry.

"Play Quidditch at all?"

"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my
house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"

"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know
I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in
Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing
he could say something a bit more interesting.

"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing
at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.

"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
"He works at Hogwarts."

"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't
he?"

"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.

"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,
and ends up setting fire to his bed."

"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.

"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?"

"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
the matter with this boy.

"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were
our kind, weren't they?"

"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."

"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're
just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some
of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
What's your surname, anyway?"

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
hopped down from the footstool.

"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).

"What's up?" said Hagrid.

"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you
wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"

"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
about Quidditch!"

"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
boy in Madam Malkin's.

"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
in."

"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what
does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones
with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look
what she had fer a sister!"

"So what is Quidditch?"

"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on
broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"

"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'
duffers, but --"

"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.

"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one."

"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"

"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.

They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag
Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and
Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,
Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."

"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the
Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'
anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more
study before yeh get ter that level."

Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says
pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited
the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined
the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung
from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself
examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,
glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.

"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday
present."

Harry felt himself go red.

"You don't have to --"

"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,
toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'
like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want
owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with
her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."

A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay
on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that
had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle
with some secret magic.

"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly
off the spindly chair.

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like
moons through the gloom of the shop.

"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.

"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.
Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It
seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
work."

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those
silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the
wizard, of course."

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to
nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.

"And that's where..."

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a
long, white finger.

"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in
the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into
the world to do...."

He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.

"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"

"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.

"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.

"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still
got the pieces, though," he added brightly.

"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.

"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now
-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver
markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?"

"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.

"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round
his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of
a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix
tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands
are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite
the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
another wizard's wand."

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.

"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on
the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a
wave."

Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.
Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.

"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --"

Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
Go on, go on, try it out."

Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
shelves, the happier he seemed to become.

"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --
holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised
the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air
and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "

He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
still muttering, "Curious... curious..

"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It
so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave
another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave
you that scar."

Harry swallowed.

"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things
happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect
great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."

Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through
the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked
down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at
them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up
another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized
where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.

"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.

Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of
his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the
words.

"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the
Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm
famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what
happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
wore a very kind smile.

"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the
beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's
hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a
great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.

"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a
letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,
Harry."

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against
the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
