It would mean a lot to me if you\u2019d nip down for the burial later this evening. I\u2019m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. I know you\u2019re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn\u2019t ask, but I can\u2019t face it alone. Hagrid",

Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master\u2019s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence \u2014 but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley\u2019s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort\u2019s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\u201d",

Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi \u2014 \u201cNo, Potter!\u201d screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape\u2019s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.",

Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister of Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle.

There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: the locket  .  .  . the cup  .  .  . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor\u2019s or Ravenclaw\u2019s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor\u2019s or Ravenclaw\u2019s . . . This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry\u2019s mind as he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb. . . .",

Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledore\u2019s body would be laid to rest. He had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore\u2019s death would be more real to him once it was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back. . . . He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.",

Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid\u2019s chair was deserted too; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but Snape\u2019s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour\u2019s entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.",

Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy\u2019s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?",

The music made the hair on Harry\u2019s neck stand up, and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore\u2019s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked around.",

He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid\u2019s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh.

Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon\u2019s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden. The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.",

It\u2019ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\u2019ll want to kill them.\u201d Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one. \u201cAltogether, then . . .\u201d Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank.

The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.",

A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table. Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet. \u201cHarry!\u201d Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously. \u201cGood to see you!\u201d",

Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.",

The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.",

As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys\u2019  .  .  . but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.",

Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur\u2019s arrow, the tip of the goblin\u2019s hat, and each of the house-elf\u2019s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \u201cThis way,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.",

It had just occurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable? Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt\u2019s deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.",

But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes. Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly. \u201cCut it out,\u201d he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded again. \u201cFirst sign of madness, talking to your own head,\u201d said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall. Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect\u2019s badge.",

Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way. It took them twenty minutes to reach King\u2019s Cross by foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry\u2019s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really going back. . . .",

They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories. In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry\u2019s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.",

The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray clouds. \u201cGuess what I got for my birthday?\u201d said Neville. \u201cAnother Remembrall?\u201d said Harry, remembering the marblelike device Neville\u2019s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.",

Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage. \u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog\u2019s head, and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning. \u201cWell, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,\u201d said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \u201cBoy and girl from each.\u201d",

        "Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes, which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy\u2019s ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.",

Rifling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.

Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn\u2019t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.",

Isn\u2019t he cute?\u201d \u201cStupid little feathery git!\u201d Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. \u201cYou bring letters to the addressee!

He pulled Sirius\u2019s reply off Pigwidgeon\u2019s leg, Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it. Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to.

Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys\u2019 snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o\u2019clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball. \u201cWhat, you need three hours?\u201d said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \u201cWho\u2019re you going with?\u201d he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle. There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o\u2019clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.",

Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn\u2019t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs. \u201cI still can\u2019t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\u201d muttered Dean.",

Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn\u2019t know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights \u2014 meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.

Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her.

She wasn\u2019t the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum\u2019s fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn\u2019t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her. Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.",

When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry.

        "\u201cI\u2019ve been promoted,\u201d Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. \u201cI\u2019m now Mr. Crouch\u2019s personal assistant, and I\u2019m here representing him.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come?\u201d Harry asked. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn\u2019t well, not well at all. Hasn\u2019t been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising \u2014 overwork. He\u2019s not as young as he was \u2014 though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but \u2014 well, as I say, he\u2019s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he\u2019s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with \u2014 that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around \u2014 no, poor man, he\u2019s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I\u2019m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.\u201d Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy \u201cWeatherby\u201d yet, but resisted the temptation.",

Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it. The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.",

        "It wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby \u2014 he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet \u2014 and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg. \u201cNice socks, Potter,\u201d Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring through Harry\u2019s robes.",

That\u2019s the whole point, you know \u2014 international magical cooperation!\u201d To Harry\u2019s displeasure, Percy now took Padma\u2019s vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him. \u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\u201d Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \u201cNo respect . . .\u201d Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table. \u201cI hope my brothers weren\u2019t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\u201d said Percy at once.",

        "\u201cThen flee,\u201d said Snape\u2019s voice curtly. \u201cFlee \u2014 I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\u201d Snape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them. \u201cTen points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!\u201d Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. \u201cAnd ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!\u201d as a boy went rushing after her. \u201cAnd what are you two doing?\u201d he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger. \u201cWe\u2019re walking,\u201d Ron told Snape shortly. \u201cNot against the law, is it?\u201d \u201cKeep walking, then!\u201d Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path. \u201cWhat\u2019s got Karkaroff all worried?\u201d Ron muttered. \u201cAnd since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?\u201d said Harry slowly.",

The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak. \u201cMomen\u2019 I saw yeh, I knew,\u201d he was saying, in an oddly husky voice. Harry and Ron froze. This didn\u2019t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer. \u201cWhat did you know, \u2019Agrid?\u201d said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.",
