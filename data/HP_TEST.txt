CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

KING’S CROSS

e lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone.
Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly
sure that he was there himself.

A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must
exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying,
definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and
the thing against which he lay existed too.
Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became
conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this
did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether,
as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered
that he had eyes.

He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever
experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor;
rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on
which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a
flat, blank something on which to be.
He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not
wearing glasses anymore.
Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that
surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed,
and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the
uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive,
shameful.

For the first time, he wished he were clothed.
Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short
distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean,
and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the
moment he had wanted them. . . .

He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of
Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great
domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a
palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and
whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . .
Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent
themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall
larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was
quite empty. He was the only person there, except for —
He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had
the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and
rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been
left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath.
He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did
not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump
back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could
not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but
it repulsed him.
“You cannot help.”

He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly
and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.
“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and
white and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us
walk.”
Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the
flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not
previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling
ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other,
staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s long silver hair and
beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked
nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . .
“But you’re dead,” said Harry.

“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.
“Then . . . I’m dead too?”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the question,
isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”
They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.
“Not?” repeated Harry.
“Not,” said Dumbledore.

“But . . .” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It
did not seem to be there. “But I should have died — I didn’t defend myself!
I meant to let him kill me!”
“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the
difference.”

Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry
had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content.
“Explain,” said Harry.
“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs
together.
“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”
“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”
“So the part of his soul that was in me . . .”
Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a
broad smile of encouragement on his face.
“. . . has it gone?”

“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole,
and completely your own, Harry.”
“But then . . .”
Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature
trembled under the chair.
“What is that, Professor?”

“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.
“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and
nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”
“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he
did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”
Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was
indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little
rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the
stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer
rose to his lips easily, without effort.

“He took my blood,” said Harry.
“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living
body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of
you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
“I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other
way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?”
He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized
creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.
“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”

“There is no help possible.”
“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.
“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to
make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he
committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the
attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less
than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself
latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.

“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which
Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of houseelves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows
and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his
own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never
grasped.

“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his
body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she
died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment
survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.
“And you knew this? You knew — all along?”
“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumbledore
happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the
creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.
“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand break
the wand he borrowed?”

“As to that, I cannot be sure.”
“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.
“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have
journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested.
But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no
wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to
Voldemort.

“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the
bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul
was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a
part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have
understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not,
perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able
to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have
murdered at all.

“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies
together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history,
Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with
yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores
reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was
twin of his, had never expected.

“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted,
even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has
never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And
in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that
echoed the relationship between their masters.

“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of
Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of
Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you,
recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated
some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than
anything Lucius’s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the
power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill:
What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?”
“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to
break it?” asked Harry.

“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort,
who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only
toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand
like any other  .  .  . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished
kindly.

Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard
to be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as
if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings,
which I am sure were severe.”

“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his
clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
“Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he
found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner
and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.”
“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. “Good
gracious, really?”

“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively.
“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.”
Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating.
He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than
that of their current location.
“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the words
wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.
“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried.
“Well?”
For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than
an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in
wrongdoing.

“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trusting
you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had
failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your
pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better
man.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s
tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.
“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate
man’s dream!”
“But they’re real!”
“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I
was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you
anymore. You know.”
“What do I know?”

Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled
in the brilliantly blue eyes.
“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than
Voldemort?”
“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you ask that?
You never killed if you could avoid it!”
“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking
reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”
“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how
odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend
Dumbledore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.”
“Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely.”
There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no
longer looked around.

“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.
Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.
“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly. “Two
clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to
Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of
Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had
died.”

“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers —”
“— were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh
yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more
likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who
succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being
Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung
up around such creations.

“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to
son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who
was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.”
Dumbledore smiled at Harry.

“Me?”
“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on
the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days
previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I
could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I
had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not
resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of
which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect  .  .  . and
then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!”
His tone was unbearably bitter.

“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said
quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak
couldn’t have made them curse-proof.”
“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.”

Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.
“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?”
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to
meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know. You cannot
despise me more than I despise myself.”

“But I don’t despise you —”
“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. “You know
the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she
became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price,
died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care
for Ariana.

“I resented it, Harry.”
Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of
Harry’s head, into the distance.
“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I
wanted glory.

“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he
looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother
and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a
remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.
“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a
damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and
bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he
came. . . .”

Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.
“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry,
inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant.
Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.
“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words.
It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a
hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what
Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we
were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.

“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they
fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the
weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone — to him,
though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I
confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all
responsibility from my shoulders.

“And the Cloak  .  .  . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much,
Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak,
the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and
shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might
be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it
completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three
objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean
‘invincible.’

“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months
of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my
family left to me.

“And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of
my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want
to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set
forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.

“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I
had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into
terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care and caution . . . lay
dead upon the floor.”

Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached
out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly
and Dumbledore gradually regained control.
“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He
vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle
torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had
encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister,
and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.
“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured
a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister
of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that
I was not to be trusted with power.”

“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!”
burst out Harry.
“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had proven,
as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is
a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are
those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust
upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own
surprise that they wear it well.

“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher —”
“You were the best —”
“— you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training
of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me,
and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.

“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look.
“Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly
matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared.
You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually
cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would
be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I
who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and
stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.
“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed
meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any
longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what
I could.

“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.”
Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found
out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he
want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore
would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why
Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised
over Harry.

They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature
behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.
At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the
wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.”
Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the
crooked nose.

“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at
Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the
horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was
his attempt to make amends  .  .  . to prevent Voldemort from taking the
Hallow . . .”

“.  .  . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and
Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.
After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Resurrection
Stone.”
Dumbledore nodded.

“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned
home of the Gaunts — the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my
youth I had wanted it for very different reasons — I lost my head, Harry. I
quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a
curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was
about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how
very, very sorry I was. . . .

“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I
was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again,
and here was final proof.”
“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them again.
What’s wrong with that?”

“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only
to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the
Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to
tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.
“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have
worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have
used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable
my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.”
Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and
smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with
Dumbledore now?

“Why did you have to make it so difficult?”
Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous.
“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was
afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that,
if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might
seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you
laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true
master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from
Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far
worse things in the living world than dying.”
“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?”

“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone
he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I
doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would
not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he
want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.”
“But you expected him to go after the wand?”

“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat
Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that
you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped
Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He
thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better
against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was
in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he
did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat
any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his
obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last
weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .”
“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the
Elder Wand, didn’t you?”

“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did not work as
I intended, did it?”
“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”
The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and
Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of
what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes,
like softly falling snow.
“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?”
“That is up to you.”
“I’ve got a choice?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross, you say?
I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s
say . . . board a train.”
“And where would it take me?”
“On,” said Dumbledore simply.
Silence again.

“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.”
“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”
“But you want me to go back?”
“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there is a
chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know
this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.”
Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in
the shadow beneath the distant chair.

“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who
live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are
maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal,
then we say good-bye for the present.”

Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard
as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful
here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more
loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long
moment into each other’s faces.
“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this been
happening inside my head?”
Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in
Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring
his figure.

“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth
should that mean that it is not real?”


CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

THE FLAW IN THE PLAN

e was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of the forest
filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his
cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by
the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place
where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad
punch. He did not stir, but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his
left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.

He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but
instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air.
“My Lord . . . my Lord . . .”

It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare
open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He
knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel
it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in
the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there,
stuffed out of sight.

“My Lord . . .”
“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice.
More footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot.
Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a
millimeter.
Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were
hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing.
Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.
Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death
Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to
the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the
Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of
them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . .
“My Lord, let me —”

“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though he could
not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. “The
boy . . . Is he dead?”
There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry,
but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the
ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.
“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain.
“Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”

Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there,
with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the
same time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of
approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . .
Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face, pulled
back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart.
He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face. He
knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.
“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”
The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her
head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers.
“Yes,” he breathed back.

He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him. Then it was
withdrawn. She had sat up.
“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.
And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their
feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot
into the air in celebration.
Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the
only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was
as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort
won.

“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is dead
by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!”
Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to
remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation
to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his
determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He
was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he
felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and
lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed
with jeers and shrieks of laughter.

“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show them what has
become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No — Wait —”
There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry
felt the ground trembling beneath him.
“You carry him,” Voldemort said. “He will be nice and visible in your
arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses — put
on the glasses — he must be recognizable —”
Someone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliberate
force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly
gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with the force of his
heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry
in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to
Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.

“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way
through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught
at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his
eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around
them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a
pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . .
The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear
trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds
rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were
drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground,
and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through
his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.
“BANE!”

Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open. “Happy
now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’ nags? Are yeh
happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead . . . ?”
Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry
wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he
dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at
the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a
freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest.
“Stop.”

Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort’s
command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them
where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that
patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his
own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his
father’s stag kept guardian in his heart.

Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort
himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so
that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon Harry’s eardrums.
“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save
himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as
proof that your hero is gone.

“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters
outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more
war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be
slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle
now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children,
your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in
the new world we shall build together.”

There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so
close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.
“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid
was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw
Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around
his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility
of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by
the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly
lightening darkness. . . .

“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .”
Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the
castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the
Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.
“Stop.”

The Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading out in a line
facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his
closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the
entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to
die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms.
“NO!”

The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or
dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard
another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in
McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the
open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out
onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry’s
death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him,
stroking Nagini’s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.

“No!”
“No!”
“Harry! HARRY!”
Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGonagall’s;
Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent,
and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause,
screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until —
“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright
light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It is over! Set him down,
Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”

Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.
“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and
forward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry Potter is dead! Do you
understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied
on others to sacrifice themselves for him!”

“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of
Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful
bang extinguished their voices once more.
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said
Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed while trying
to save himself —”

But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another
bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an
infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at
Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort
throwing the challenger’s wand aside and laughing.
“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has volunteered
to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle
is lost?”

Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.
“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the
Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”
“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who
was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the
no-man’s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. “But you are a
pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Voldemort asked Neville, who stood
facing him, his empty hands curled in fists.
“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly.
“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will
make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville
Longbottom.”

“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s
Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd,
whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.
“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the
silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your
choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said
quietly, “be it.”

Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand.
Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows, something that
looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in
Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it
dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.
“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Voldemort.
“There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my
noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won’t they,
Neville Longbottom?”

He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the
hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were
movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the
Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone
foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a flick
of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot,
unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act —
And then many things happened at the same moment.

They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what
sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls
and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time,
Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled,
“HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort’s giants: They
ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came
hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst
the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the
Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang
to his feet, as Neville moved too.

In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse
upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths
something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle —
The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the
oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding
centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville
sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in
the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open
in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to
the ground at his feet —

Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm
between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then,
over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling
giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all.
“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY — WHERE’S HARRY?”
Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters,
everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer and nearer
thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry
saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants,
thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp
punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts
and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was
shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they
crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were
trampled by the retreating crowd.

Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the
entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the
room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still
screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and
right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort’s would-be victims,
Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall,
where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps,
and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still
wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of
what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who
had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of
Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall
with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the
kitchens was blasted off its hinges.

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming
and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of
Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog’s voice
audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of
house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!”
They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters,
their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death
Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells,
dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply
attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.
But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling
prisoners, and into the Great Hall.

Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting
all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer,
still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as
everyone who could walk forced their way inside.
Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw
Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick’s hands, saw Walden Macnair
thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide
unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir
Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring
Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd,
not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.
Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at
once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around
him, unable to finish him —

Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like
her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all
battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry’s attention
was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death
by an inch —

He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before
he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.
“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”

Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix
spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.
“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with
a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and
elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix
Lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both
wands, the floor around the witches’ feet became hot and cracked; both
women were fighting to kill.

“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come
to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!”
Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights,
Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood,
invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to
be sure that he would not hit the innocent.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted
Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around
her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”
“You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!” screamed
Mrs. Weasley.

Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given
as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what
was going to happen before it did.
Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her
squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest
space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the
watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.

Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall,
Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the
air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with
the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly
Weasley.

“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle
of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off
the Invisibility Cloak at last.
The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!”
“HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell
abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and
began, at the same moment, to circle each other.
“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said loudly, and in the
total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to be like this. It’s
got to be me.”

Voldemort hissed.
“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t how he
works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?”
“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just
you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is
about to leave for good. . . .”

“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red
eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. “You think it will be you, do
you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was
pulling the strings?”
“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry. They
were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining
the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but
Voldemort’s. “Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard?
Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and
returned to fight again?”

“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the
watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall,
nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and chance and the fact
that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women,
and permitted me to kill them for you!”
“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled,
and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red. “You won’t be able to kill
any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you
from hurting these people —”
“But you did not!”

“— I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did.
They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells
you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them.
You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”
“You dare —”
“Yes, I dare,” said Harry. “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I
know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you
make another big mistake?”

Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he
kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held back by the faintest
possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . .
“Is it love again?” said Voldemort, his snake’s face jeering.
“Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death,
though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old
waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood
mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to
run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now
when I strike?”

“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in
each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.
“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must
believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful
than mine?”

“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike
face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the
sound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it
echoed around the silent Hall.
“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I, than Lord
Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never
dreamed of?”

“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew
enough not to do what you’ve done.”
“You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to dare, too
weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!”
“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better
man.”

“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”
“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”
For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people
around the walls drew breath as one.
“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though
they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble
tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not
return!”

“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him
killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died,
arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.”
“What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike,
and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s.
“Severus Snape wasn’t yours,” said Harry. “Snape was Dumbledore’s,
Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And
you never realized it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never
saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?”
Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like
wolves about to tear each other apart.

“Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my mother’s,
because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were
children. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils
flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”
“He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had
gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier
of him —”

“Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy
from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you
ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with
rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not
whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they
tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s
supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you
do not understand!

“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended
that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of
you, little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it,
I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three
hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly
mine! Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d
advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some
remorse, Riddle. . . .”
“What is this?”

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or
taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils
contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.
“It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve
seen what you’ll be otherwise.  .  .  . Be a man  .  .  . try  .  .  . Try for some
remorse. . . .”

“You dare — ?” said Voldemort again.
“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t
backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.”
Voldemort’s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped
Draco’s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.
“That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered
the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder
Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.”

“He killed —”
“Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s
death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated,
the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power
would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!”
“But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!”
Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure. “I stole the wand from its
last master’s tomb! I removed it against its last master’s wishes! Its power
is mine!”

“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough!
Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to
Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized
a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a
hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his
will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most
dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . .”
Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse
coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was
gone.

“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, it
makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand:
We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco
Malfoy. . . .”

“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got
there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”
Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in
the Hall upon it.

“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the
wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it
does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as
an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The
light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was
suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled
his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s wand:

“Avada Kedavra!”
“Expelliarmus!”
The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted
between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading,
marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet
meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise,
spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning
through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take
full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker,
caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed,
the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor
with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands
empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead,
killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his
hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended:
and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and
the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the
windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron
and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their
incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna
were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and
McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that
anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him,
trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them
determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last —
The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life
and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of
jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there
with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he
had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to
occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness
their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every
quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the
country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else
being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that
very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary
Minister of Magic. . . .

They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away
from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who
had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but
nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled
together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves,
and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a
smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth.
After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a
bench beside Luna.

“I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said.
“I’d love some,” he replied.
“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”
And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering
Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked
around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.
Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted
Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s
shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years
in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his
plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle
between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled
together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there,
but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw
families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved
most.

“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will you come
with me?”
They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left the Great
Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the
balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as
they climbed.

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the
corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:
We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one,
And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!

“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?”
said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.
Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled
by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him
like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most
stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation
to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who
deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the
Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun
to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the
place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned
their destination.

Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the
headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a
little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to
distinguish passwords anymore.
“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle.
“Feel free,” groaned the statue.

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved
slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.
He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had
left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses
and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort —
But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and
headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they
waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their
frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in
which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter
Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his
high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part!
Let our contribution not be forgotten!”

But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait
directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding down from
behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride
and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as
phoenix song.

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent,
beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He
directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous
care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last
effort, seeking one last piece of advice.

“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the
forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it
again. Do you agree?”

“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked
confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I
would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”
“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.
“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and
Dumbledore beamed.

“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”
“And then there’s this.”
Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a
reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not
like to see.

“I don’t want it,” said Harry.
“What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?”
“I know it’s powerful,” said Harry wearily. “But I was happier with mine.
So . . .”

He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two
halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather.
Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too
severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.
He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the
very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, “Reparo.”
As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he
had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden
warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their
reunion.

“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching
him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from. It
can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken,
won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the
end of it.”

Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.
“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his
voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.
“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.
“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And quite
honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of
the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and
wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had
enough trouble for a lifetime.”


CHAPER EPILOGUE

NINETEEN YEARS LATER

utumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first
of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little
family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the
fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs
in the cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the
parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the
redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s
arm.

“It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her.
“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!”
The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way
toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted
back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the
argument they had started in the car.

“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!”
“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.
“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother.
“There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth —”
But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters
approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his
younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a
run. A moment later, he had vanished.
“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately,
capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.
“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.

“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get
letters from home about once a month.”
“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.
“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,”
Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As
they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the
family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured
by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.
Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had
already disappeared.

“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they
passed as they made their way down the platform.
“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly.
But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s
faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry
thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and
was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .
“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.

A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the
very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny,
Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.
“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.
Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed
at him.
“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t
believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to
Confund the examiner.”

“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”
“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as
together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to
look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm
for that.”

Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother,
having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted
into when they finally went to Hogwarts.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no
pressure.”

“Ron!”
Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer
paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some
fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people
stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.
“Look who it is.”

Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat
buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which
emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as
Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and
Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you
beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s
brains.”

“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t
try to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!”
“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added,
“Don’t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would
never forgive you if you married a pureblood.”
“Hey!”

James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and
trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.
“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his
shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And guess
what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!”

He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I
asked Teddy what he was doing —”

“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron —”
“— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go
away. He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made
himself clear.

“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ecstatically.
“Teddy would really be part of the family then!”
“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said
Harry. “Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with
it?”

“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing with Al —
Teddy could have my room!”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want
the house demolished.”
He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”
“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged
him.

“Mum! I can’t give a professor love!”
“But you know Neville —”
James rolled his eyes.
“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t
walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .”
Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by
aiming a kick at Albus.

“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”
“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”
But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his
father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him
wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.
“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus. “They’re
gentle things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be
going up to school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.”
Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.

“See you at Christmas.”
“Bye, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s
invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone
till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.”
“What if I’m in Slytherin?”

The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the
moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and
sincere that fear was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own.
Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.
“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could
hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was
now on the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One
of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”
“But just say —”

“— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it?
It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose
Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”
“Really?”

“It did for me,” said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder
in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along
the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward
for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and
Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the
windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off,
seemed to be turned toward Harry.

“Why are they all staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned
around to look at the other students.
“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.”
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and
Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with
excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little
bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . .

The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a
corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.
“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched
the lightning scar on his forehead.
“I know he will.”
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.


CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

THE FINAL HIDING PLACE

here was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was
going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair
they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as
they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a grayand-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an
escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, he
clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his
burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of
a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron
kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the
dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but
getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the
question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather
frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing,
nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good
place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could
feel his scar prickling. . . .

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into
the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify
Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then,
when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would
know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. . . .

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed steadily
until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no
longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out
of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches
of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape
like strips of matte and glossy ribbon.
“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew farther
and farther north.

“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with cold but he
did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time
what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon
headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately
hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten?
Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it
realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the
dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its
enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every part
of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of
silence, “or are we losing height?”

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in
the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he
squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had
divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.
Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it
seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.

“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to the
others. “Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”
They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the
dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
“NOW!”

He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward
the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he
hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled
world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous
ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had
fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: It was already
fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred
snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the
depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at
last on a distant bank.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did
not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way
through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden,
panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have
happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand,
and started casting the usual protective spells around them.
When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he
had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red
burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in
places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their
many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three
bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry
robes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.

“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin
on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the downside —”
“— no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany
through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.
“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab . . .”
Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just
taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it
drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.
“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging round
our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.
Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was
still drinking.

“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all right?”
“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it can look
after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they
might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”
All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to
stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on
the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.
“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping
herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who will
know we know about his Horcruxes!”

“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron hopefully. “Maybe
they’ll cover up —”
The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were
extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was
standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on
the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.
“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and
fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded — but it could not be
true, he could not see how . . .

The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his.
“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”
“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, “mmy Lord . . . we t-tried t-to st-stop them. . . . Im-impostors, my Lord . . .
broke — broke into the — into the Lestranges’ v-vault. . . .”
“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing
impostors? Who were they?”

“It was . . . it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two accomplices. . . .”
“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him.
“Tell me! What did they take?”
“A . . . a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord . . .”
The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He was
crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever
known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?

The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through
the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards
scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others
behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell,
and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news,
for hearing about the golden cup —

Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before
him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality —
the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy
knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced
more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had
always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore,
whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death
through the boy, the boy —

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord
Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard
of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how
many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord Voldemort not have
known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked,
mutilated?

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had
thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost . . .
No, surely, the rest were safe . . . The other Horcruxes must be intact. . . .
But he must know, he must be sure . . . He paced the room, kicking aside
the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his
boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts —
A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that
he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to
be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had
never been traced to him: The ring, surely, was safe.
And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or
penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd. . . .
As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the
Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that
place. . . .

And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to
do his bidding, under his protection. . . .
But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding
places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes. . . . A
job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone . . .
Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease
flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name  .  .  .
Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts  .  .  . Their
abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was
there that he would go first. . . .
The lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight possibility that
Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the
orphanage.

And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would
be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the
school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the
boy might try to reenter the castle  .  .  . To tell Snape why the boy might
return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust
Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how
unwise it was ever to trust?

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: He
would not be parted from the snake anymore  . . . and he strode from the
room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain
played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him
like a long shadow. . . .

Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He
was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione
were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the
continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort’s mind
had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that
he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass
before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun.
“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s
high screams. “He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are, and
the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew
it.”

“What?”
Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried.
“But what did you see? How do you know?”
“I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s” — Harry
remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t
understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe,
the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there,
because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one
last, but he could still be there within hours —”
“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his
feet too.

“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about
exactly where it is —”
“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry
pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we haven’t got a
plan, we need to —”

“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep,
looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now.
“Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the
locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t
safe enough?”

“But how are we going to get in?”
“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” said Harry, “and try to work something out
once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the
Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.”
“But we don’t really fit —”

“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”
The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The
dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their
preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the
rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then
Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two. Harry
pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the
spot into the crushing darkness.



CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

THE MISSING MIRROR

arry’s feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade
High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains
beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward
Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks,
and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how
he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak
Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he
relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he had
realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and
he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked
at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst
open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street,
their wands aloft.

Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of
them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One of the
Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around
the distant mountains.

“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters.
Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning
Charm had not worked on it.

“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater who had
tried the charm, and then to his fellows, “Spread out. He’s here.”
Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione
backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death
Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the
footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from
the Death Eaters’ searching wands.

“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”
“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death Eater
shouted,
“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find
you!”
“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to tell
them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us
—”

“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free
rein, they’d find him quick enough!”
“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.

“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the
street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which
vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and
together, they turned on the spot.

The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become
solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms
well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry’s flesh. He, Ron,
and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the
wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding
noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they
were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks
and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity?
Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking
those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air,
closing in —

He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Dementor’s Kiss,
whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought
as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors
scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.
“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!”
The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the
footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his
panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door
opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said,
“Potter, in here, quick!”

He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through the open
doorway.
“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure, passing
them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him.
Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering
light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog’s Head
Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led
to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. The
stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small
fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who
gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.

Shouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the Invisibility
Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior,
whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s Head’s barman, was the only
person not wearing a hood.

“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So what?
You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ’em! I’m
not having ’em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it!”
“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. “That was a stag, it was
Potter’s!”
“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You idiot —
Expecto Patronum!”
Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it
charged toward the High Street and out of sight.
“That’s not what I saw —” said the Death Eater, though with less
certainty.

“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told
the barman. “Someone was out in the street against regulations —”
“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!”
“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”
“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my
nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your
sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He’s
not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?”
“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about
yourself, breaking curfew!”

“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s
closed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then?”
“Are you threatening — ?”
“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”
“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death Eater.
“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”
“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater. “Break
curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”

The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermione moaned
with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobblelegged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the Cloak off
himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the
door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.
Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small,
rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.
The barman entered the room.

“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of
them. “What were you thinking, coming here?”
“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you enough. You saved our
lives.”

The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face,
trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard. He wore
spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.
“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”
There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each
other.

“You sent Dobby.”
The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.
“Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?”
“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”
The barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m
sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.”
He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at
any of them.

“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.
He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.
“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror,
the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.
“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me
what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”
Ron gasped.

“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”
“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth.
“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”
“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just proved
my Patronus is a goat?”
“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as
his stomach gave an enormous rumble.
“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing
moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of
mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they
ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the
fire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of chewing.

“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and Harry
and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to think of the best
way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night, you heard what happens
if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off,
they’ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be
able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when
curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get
right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to
Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there
with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.”

“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.”
“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth.
“We’ve got to,” said Harry.
“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to get as
far from here as you can.”
“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get into the
castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your brother — wanted us —”
The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momentarily
opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the
giant spider, Aragog.

“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and people
had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You
get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget
my brother and his clever schemes. He’s gone where none of this can hurt
him, and you don’t owe him anything.”
“You don’t understand,” said Harry again.

“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I understood my
own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?”
“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with
exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s . . . he left me a job.”
“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort
of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without
overstretching themselves?”

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.
“I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to —”
“‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth roughly.
“Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”
“I can’t.”

“Why not?”
“I —” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the
offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order of the
Phoenix —”
“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished. YouKnow-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s
kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you
too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two
with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger
long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.”
“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job —”
“Give it to someone else!”

“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all —”
“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with
you?”
Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple
word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was
thinking.

“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee.
Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural.”
The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the
mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in
the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone
else.

“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your sister?
Ariana?”
“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you,
missy?”
Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned
red.
“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare
Hermione.

“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead.
“Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he did. Well, so
did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.”
Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties
about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his
choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to continue along the
winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept
that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to
trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that
would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was
so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same
impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry
thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.
“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Hermione in
a low voice.

“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the people
my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he’d
left ’em well alone.”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.
“Never you mind,” said Aberforth.
“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are you — are
you talking about your sister?”
Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words
he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.
“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three
Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden
hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no witch or wizard can at that
age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through
the hedge, and when she couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried
away trying to stop the little freak doing it.”

Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick.
Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the
intensity of his pain.

“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn’t
use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her
mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she
was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and
harmless.

“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, “and
attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said
why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had
become, she’d have been locked up in St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have
seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy,
unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when
she couldn’t keep it in any longer.
“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she
was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and
happy.

“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy
seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard. “Not
Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his
books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with
‘the most notable magical names of the day,’” Aberforth sneered. “He
didn’t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat
when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when
she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me
feed the goats.

“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said Aberforth.
“If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages,
and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and  .  .  . it was an accident.
Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”
Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to
hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it
had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever
spoken about it.

“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge. The
pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on
his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!”
Aberforth spat into the fire.

“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school, I’d
have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and
he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there’s
no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the
house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.”
And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face.
“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone
just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a
backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding
order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so
interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one
young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for
the greater good?

“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for
me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I
am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it took little
imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder
brother. “I told him, you’d better give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s
in no fit state, you can’t take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to
go, when you’re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up
a following. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly
occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and
blind again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry. He told me
what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my
brilliant brother . . . Didn’t I understand, my poor sister wouldn’t have to be
hidden once they’d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding,
and taught the Muggles their place?

“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled
out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother’s best
friend — and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were
dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn’t stand
it —”

The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had suffered a
mortal wound.
“— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know what she
was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us
— and she was dead.”
His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest
chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as
Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it,
wished he could wash his mind clean of it.
“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered.
“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.
“’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already,
back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too.
And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to
become the greatest wizard of the —”
“He was never free,” said Harry.
“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.
“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a potion
that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with
someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.’”
Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details
about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had
taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed
it so thoroughly.

“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he
did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. “He
thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . . It was
torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.”
Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined
hands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my
brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can
you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like my little sister?”
A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.

“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.
“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth. “Why didn’t
he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’?”
“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes
you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you’ve
got to think about the greater good! This is war!”

“You’re seventeen, boy!”
“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!”
“Who says I’ve given up?”
“‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’” Harry repeated. “‘You-KnowWho’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding
themselves.’”
“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”
“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-KnowWho and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until I
succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve
known it for years.”

He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely
scowled.
“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t help us,
we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in
ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great time to mention
it.”

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that
were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got
to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of
Ariana.

“You know what to do,” he said.
She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually
did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long
tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until
finally she was swallowed by the darkness.

“Er — what — ?” began Ron.
“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know they’ve
got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all
around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my
sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you
expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the
Carrows as his deputies  .  .  . well, that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say
you’re prepared to die.”

“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture.
A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now
Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she
came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she
was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than
Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his
face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures
grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole
thing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real
tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his
robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of
delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come!
I knew it, Harry!”



CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

THE LOST DIADEM

eville — what the — how — ?”
But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of
delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the
worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there
were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested
that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, “I knew you’d come!

Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!”
“Neville, what’s happened to you?”
“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head.
“This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then?
Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple more people on
the way.”

“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you mean, a
couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on
the whole village!”

“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,” said
Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you?
Thanks a lot.”

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto
the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry
addressed Aberforth.

“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.”
“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be able to
save ’em a third time.”

Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind
Ariana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked
as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from
the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their
shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.
“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on the
Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in
and out of school?”

“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said Neville.
“There’s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses
over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.” He
started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. “Never mind that
stuff  .  .  . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a
dragon? It’s everywhere, everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten
up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”
“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry.
Neville laughed gleefully.

“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as
a pet —”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just
been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to
something.”

“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we
haven’t heard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville,
the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the
Carrows?”

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”

“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to
refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they
can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the
Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice
the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory
for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like
animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being
vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got
this one,” he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much
Muggle blood she and her brother have got.”
“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a
smart mouth.”

“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either.
The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope.
I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”
“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing slightly
as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown into even greater
relief.

Neville shrugged.
“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood, so they’ll
torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually kill us.”
Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying
or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.
“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives
on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno
Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged
Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.”
“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her —”
“Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.”
From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one
of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to send one another
messages.

“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The
Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad.
We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore’s
Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.”
“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.
“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna
at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us
were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of
it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went
and got caught releasing a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured
him pretty badly. That scared people off.”

“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward.
“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we
dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing
underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they
decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for
Gran.”

“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.
“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was
climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really
well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only
a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,” he
faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit
off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone,
they probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly
powerful. Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and
Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast
pocket of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’
son, and to keep it up.”

“Cool,” said Ron.
“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized they
had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all.
I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban;
either way, I knew it was time to disappear.”
“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we
heading straight back into Hogwarts?”

“’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”
They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage.
Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind
Ariana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry
followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people:
“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”
As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several
screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!” “Ron!”
“Hermione!”

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many
faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged,
pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed
to be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch final.
“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed away,
Harry was able to take in their surroundings.

He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and looked rather
like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a
gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling
and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless
walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold
Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set
against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and
green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few
broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large woodencased wireless.
“Where are we?”

“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed itself,
hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance
for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found!
Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there
was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it’s expanded as
more and more of the D.A. have arrived.”
“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around for the
door.

“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he
spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper hideout, as long
as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the door won’t open. It’s all
down to Neville. He really gets this room. You’ve got to ask it for exactly
what you need — like, ‘I don’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get
in’ — and it’ll do it for you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the
loopholes! Neville’s the man!”

“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d been in
here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could
get something to eat, and that’s when the passage to the Hog’s Head opened
up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He’s been providing us with food,
because for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.”
“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of
Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.
“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Seamus,
“and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even
sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —”
“— and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lavender
Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked
around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were
there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and
Michael Corner.

“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve been so
many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.” He
pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into Gringotts?”
“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”
There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.
“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.
Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry
felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back
hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement
vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting
floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open
and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside
his head.

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind again, back
to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring
from his face and Ron holding him up.
“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down? I
expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?”
“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them
without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the
other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit
Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.
“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him that they
understood.

“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s the
plan?”
“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent
himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was still burning.
“Well, there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and I — need to do, and
then we’ll get out of here.”
Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused.
“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”
“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to
soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need to do —”
“What is it?”

“I — I can’t tell you.”
There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows contracted.
“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-KnowWho, right?”
“Well, yeah —”
“Then we’ll help you.”

The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some
enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to
demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.
“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last
few hours. “We — we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do it — alone.”
“Why?” asked Neville.

“Because . . .” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux,
or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where
they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his
thoughts. His scar was still searing. “Dumbledore left the three of us a job,”
he said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, he wanted us
to do it, just the three of us.”
“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all in it
together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on
your own —”

“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron.
“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Everyone in
this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here because the
Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s proven they’re loyal
to Dumbledore — loyal to you.”
“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it
did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind him.
“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be
here!”

It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug
his best friend.
“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”
“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing here? How did you
— ?”
“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I promised
her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that if
you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow
Snape and the Carrows.”

“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly. “Isn’t it, Harry?
We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?”
“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s
not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to do, and then
—”

“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael Corner.
“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it’s
all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who —”
“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part of it!”
There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart
seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall,
closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a
radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how
beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.
“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer
to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a
railway station.”

Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old
girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.
“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she
walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.
“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George.
“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance
of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still
burning so fiercely.
“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,” said
Fred.
“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call them all
back for? This is insane —”
“We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. “The
message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I’ll have to get a
wand, though —”
“You haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus.
Ron turned suddenly to Harry.
“Why can’t they help?”

“What?”
“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them
could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, “We don’t know where
it is. We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to tell them it’s a Horcrux.”
Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think Ron’s
right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need them.” And
when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone,
Harry.”

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split
again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and
Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and
Albus . . . he was a natural. . . . Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping
his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted
Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest
tower . . .

“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to the
room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been
cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them
looked alert, excited.

“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Something —
something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts,
but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has
anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across
something with her eagle on it, for instance?”
He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma,
Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the
arm of Ginny’s chair.

“Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The
lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to duplicate it.”
“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, “is
lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”
“When was it lost?” asked Harry.
“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Professor
Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have
looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, “nobody’s ever found
a trace of it, have they?”
They all shook their heads.
“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron.
“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed to
have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”
“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons —”
But Harry cut across Luna.

“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”
They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and
his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been
lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good
candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle.  .  .  . Before he could
formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.
“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I could take
you up to our common room and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw’s wearing it
in her statue.”

Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement
swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him
and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was
flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did
not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left.
“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at
Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much of a lead, but I’m
going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks
like. Wait for me here and keep, you know — the other one — safe.”
Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No, Luna will
take Harry, won’t you, Luna?”

“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again,
looking disappointed.
“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville.
“Over here.”
He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto
a steep staircase.
“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able
to find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re
going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always
patrolling the corridors at night.”

“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”
He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and
turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to
be solid wall.

“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away
from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”
They crept off.

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had
his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe
passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor,
past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft
footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and
Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted,
twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to
themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst
fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first,
telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him
toward a spiral staircase.

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here
before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:
nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the
shape of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair,
unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it
sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened,
but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the
phoenix or the flame?”

“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna.
“What if you get it wrong?”
“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said Luna.
“That way you learn, you see?”
“Yeah  .  .  . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone else,
Luna.”

“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I think the
answer is that a circle has no beginning.”
“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open.
The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier
than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows
punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day,
the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding
mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were
echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and
bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white
marble.

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at
Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to
dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed
to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet
slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in
marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her
wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from
under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.
“‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’”
“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice.
Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The
sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and
even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull
and snake branded on her forearm.


CHAPTER THIRTY

THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE

he moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar burned
savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing
upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around
him and there was triumph in his heart — They have the boy.
A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he
raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she
hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.

“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said Luna,
sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought it would be.”
And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing
footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the
dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.
“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”

Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let
the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of
Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There
were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious.
Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any
moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her
and prodded her backside with his big toe.

“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.
“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in
around Alecto. “They’re pleased!”
“Yeah . . . great . . .”

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again
into Voldemort’s mind . . . He was moving along the tunnel into the first
cave . . . He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . . but
that would not take him long. . . .

There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze.
From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the
eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?”
“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was
that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have
you got him? Open the door!”

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then,
without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody
was firing a gun into the door.
“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter — d’you want to go
the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus bellowed, shaking
the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were
all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back
up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he
ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater
could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the
door.

“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”
“Trying — to get — through this damned — door!” shouted Amycus.
“Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!”
“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall. “Didn’t
Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request?
Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn’t wake up half
the castle.”

“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!”
“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with awful
coldness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice
asked again,
“Where do Vanished objects go?”
“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” replied Professor
McGonagall.
“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung
open.

The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as
Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his
sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on
Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.
“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruciate the
lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s the Dark Lord going to
say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the
forehead with his fist. “We haven’t got him, and they’ve gorn and killed
her!”

“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had
stooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all right.”
“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after the Dark
Lord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and
he thinks we’ve got Potter!”
“‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do you mean,
‘got Potter’?”
“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send
for him if we caught him!”
“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter
belongs in my House!”

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her
voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.
“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno why, do I?”
Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room.
Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.
“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly
crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the
kids, them kids up there” — he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the
dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced her to press her Mark, and that’s
why he got a false alarm. . . . He can punish them. Couple of kids more or
less, what’s the difference?”

“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said
Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which
you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing
very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the
students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.”
“Excuse me?”

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor
McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but
looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck
to a lavatory seat.
“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time’s
over. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay
the price.”

And he spat in her face.
Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You
shouldn’t have done that.”
As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”
The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a
drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a
shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled,
insensible, to the floor.

“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through
his brain, “you need to really mean it.”
“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter
— you’re here! What — ? How — ?” She struggled to pull herself together.
“Potter, that was foolish!”
“He spat at you,” said Harry.
“Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t you realize
— ?”
“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him.
“Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”

“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of
interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second
outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered
backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan
dressing gown.

“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry told
Luna. “He already knows where I am.”
In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the angry,
burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the
ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island where the stone
basin stood. . . .
“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as
quickly as you can!”

“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor, do you
know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”
“The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t it been lost for
centuries?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness, utter
madness, for you to enter this castle —”
“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here that I’m
supposed to find, and it could be the diadem — if I could just speak to
Professor Flitwick —”

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming
round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her
feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, “Imperio.”
Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then
shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with
his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor
McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope
appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them
tightly together.

“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with
superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named does indeed know that you are here —”
As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry,
setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin
whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe
beneath the surface —
“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back: He was
clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.
“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m acting on
Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we’ve got
to get the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s me Voldemort
wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now —” not
now he knows I’m attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his
head.

“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of
dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.
“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while
you search for this — this object.”
“Is that possible?”
“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather
good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a
while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to
be done about Professor Snape —”
“Let me —”

“— and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord
at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people
out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and
Apparition impossible within the grounds —”
“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the
passageway leading into the Hog’s Head.
“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students —”
“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are
concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone
who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.”

“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at the
Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around
them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the blueand-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. “Come. We must alert
the other Heads of House. You’d better put that Cloak back on.”
She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand.
From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their
eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with
silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down.
Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them;
Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and
Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.
They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps
joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt
in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s Map, but before he could
take it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. She
halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”
“It is I,” said a low voice.

From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.
Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the details
of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his
greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes
had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in
his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.
“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.
“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor
McGonagall.

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall
into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his
wand up too, ready to attack.
“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had apprehended
an intruder.”
“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that
impression?”
Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark
Mark was branded into his skin.
“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eaters have
your own private means of communication, I forgot.”
Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air
all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly
noticing what he was doing.
“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.”
“You have some objection?”
“I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late
hour?”

“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Really? But all seems calm.”
Snape looked into her eyes.
“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must
insist —”
Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her
wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that
Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm
was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her
wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to
curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending
flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a
lasso at Snape —

Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall
blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a
swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of
armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after
another, into its breast —
“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding
Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting
up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous
Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.
“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do no more murder at
Hogwarts!”

Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken
shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing
arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to
dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When
Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and
Sprout all thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and,
moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”
“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna.
Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing
the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where
Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed
window.

“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the
room.
“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick’s
and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.
“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he
was still carrying a wand  .  .  . and he seems to have learned a few tricks
from his master.”

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape
flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.
There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing:
Slughorn had just caught up.
“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emeraldgreen silk pajamas. “My dear boy  .  .  . what a surprise  .  .  . Minerva, do
please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ?”

“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGonagall,
pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.
“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the
Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat
bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder
in his heart —

“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!”
“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told the other
teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. “Potter
has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s orders. We need to put in
place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he
needs to do.”

“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out YouKnow-Who indefinitely?” squeaked Flitwick.
“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout.
“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between the two
witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I suggest we establish
basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the
Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over
age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.”
“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. “I
shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.”
And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering,
“Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pods . . . yes, I’d like to see the
Death Eaters fighting those.”

“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out
of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started
muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing
noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the
grounds.

“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Professor,
I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where
the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”

“— Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked Flitwick.
“A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would
be much use in this situation!”

“I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?”
“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!”
Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then,
was the Horcrux?

“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said
Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.
They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.
“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver.
“What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is
bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him
will be in most grievous peril —”

“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty
minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave with your
students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our
resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we
duel to kill.”

“Minerva!” he said, aghast.
“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,”
interrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your students, Horace.”
Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after
Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the
corridor and raised her wand.

“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now —”
The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students
out of bed! Students in the corridors!”
“They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGonagall.
“Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!”
“P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name
before.

“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining about him
for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!”
Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her
senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.
“And now — Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall.
And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down
from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and
below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the
same.

“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man the
boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past
Harry: some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals
too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on
chains.

“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better
return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the
other Gryffindors.”

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back
toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran,
they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their
pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”

“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the
Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which
opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh — ?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It
was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there.
Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie
Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley.

“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the
stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run
for it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”
“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred explained.
“You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the
Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.”
“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”

“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in the
Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.”
There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was
pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of
the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old Quidditch
team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.
“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand;
she took it and followed him back up the stairs.
The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in
the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was
struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and
Fleur.

“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry
approached. “I won’t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got to go
home!”
“I won’t!”
Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip.
“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army —”
“A teenagers’ gang!”

“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one else has
dared to do!” said Fred.
“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old enough! What you
two were thinking, bringing her with you —”
Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.
“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Everyone
underage will have to leave, it’s only right.”
“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My
whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and
—”

Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly,
but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly.
“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog’s
Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and —”

There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clambered
out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on
the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and
said, “Am I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I — I —”
Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into
most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by
Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break
the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle Teddy?”

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed
to be solidifying, like ice.
“I — oh yes — he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with him —
at her mother’s —”

Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen.
“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from
inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby
with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera.
“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his
photograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a — a —”
“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,” said Fred.
Percy swallowed.

“Yes, I was!”
“Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, holding out his hand to
Percy.
Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and
pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes
on his father.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said.
Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son.
“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.

“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his
glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to find a way out and
it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprisoning traitors all the time. I
managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes
ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.”

“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,”
said George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous manner. “Now
let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken.”
“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur
as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George.
“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.
Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak
upstairs too.

“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay here, then
at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on, but she won’t be
in the middle of the fighting?”
“I —”

“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you stay in this
room, you hear me?”
Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s
unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed
off for the stairs as well.
“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?”
“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called
over his shoulder.
“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry.
“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long after you
left.”

“A bathroom?”
Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of
Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.
“You’re sure they said bath — ?”
But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was
looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boars on pillars at
either side, looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was
ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed
of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.


CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS

he enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with
stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with
disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns.
Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every
eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was
speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood
the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the
members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.

“.  .  . evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey.
Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your
charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.”
Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the
walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie
Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we
want to stay and fight?”

There was a smattering of applause.
“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall.
“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. “Our
trunks, our owls?”
“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGonagall.
“The important thing is to get you out of here safely.”
“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.
“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor
McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs,
and Ravenclaws.

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for
Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great
deal of whispering broke out in his wake.
“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor
McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we
reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do
as your prefects —”

But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout
the Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no telling from where it
came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had
once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.
“I know that you are preparing to fight.” There were screams amongst the
students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for
the source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do
not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do
not want to spill magical blood.”

There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against
the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.
“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be
harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give
me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.

“You have until midnight.”
The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in
the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of
thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table
and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and
screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!”

Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The
Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the
Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the
Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking
toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands
emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped
voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House
could follow.”

Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins
trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.
Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely
deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their
fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of
Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s
descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.
“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”
Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor
table.

“Where are Ron and Hermione?”
“Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.
But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform
to address those who had remained behind.
“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A
battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order
of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to
take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — Ravenclaw,
Astronomy, and Gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview,
excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus” — he
indicated Lupin — “Arthur” — he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at
the Gryffindor table — “and I will take groups into the grounds. We’ll need
somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the
school —”

“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and George,
and Kingsley nodded his approval.
“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!”
“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students
flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, “Aren’t
you supposed to be looking for something?”
“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”
He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the
battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable
absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought
from his mind.

“Then go, Potter, go!”
“Right — yeah —”
He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into
the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself
to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off
along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought
processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux,
but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped
beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem
to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an
empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and
pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not
see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though the density of the
crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he
thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over
his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . .

Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.
There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed
Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be
one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux
was connected to that House.

But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the
lost diadem  .  .  . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it
possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had
eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to
look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?
In living memory . . .

Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the
plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last
hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of
Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs.
Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in
their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw
Zacharias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue;
here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called
desperately for friends or siblings. . . .

Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance
hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor
Tower, stood waiting for him.

“Harry! My dear boy!”
Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”

Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and
saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her
eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding
smoothly away from him.

“Hey — wait — come back!”
She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry
supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length
cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her
as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had
never spoken.

“You’re the Gray Lady?”
She nodded but did not speak.
“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
“That is correct.”
Her tone was not encouraging.
“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about
the lost diadem.”
A cold smile curved her lips.
“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.”
“WAIT!”

He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to
overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him: It
was a quarter to midnight.
“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got
to find it, fast.”
“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said
disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered me —”
“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at her. “It’s
about Voldemort — defeating Voldemort — or aren’t you interested in
that?”
She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque,
and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I — how dare you
suggest — ?”

“Well, help me, then!”
Her composure was slipping.
“It — it is not a question of —” she stammered. “My mother’s diadem
—”
“Your mother’s?”
She looked angry with herself.
“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.”
“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!”
“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to
pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of
defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord —”
“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry said
fiercely. “There’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts, if
you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell me anything you
know about the diadem!”

She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a
sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known
anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely
asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away
when she spoke in a low voice.
“I stole the diadem from my mother.”
“You — you did what?”

“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. “I sought
to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with
it.”

He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence, and did
not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on:
“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but
pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal,
even from the other founders of Hogwarts.

“Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was
desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me,
though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest
until he had done so.”

Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.
“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return
with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man.
Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.”
“The Baron? You mean — ?”

“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the
cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. “When he
saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon
that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries
later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,” she added
bitterly.

“And . . . and the diadem?”
“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering
through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.”
“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?”
“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my
mother’s reach.”

“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from
confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had
denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told someone this story,
haven’t you? Another student?”

She closed her eyes and nodded.
“I had  .  .  . no idea.  .  .  . He was  .  .  . flattering. He seemed to  .  .  . to
understand . . . to sympathize. . . .”
Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena
Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.
“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,” Harry
muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . .”
So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem
out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved
the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts,
before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.
And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent
refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low,
undisturbed, for ten long years?

But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in
that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true
home, and Voldemort must have put it there —
“— the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing his thought.
“I beg your pardon?”

“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let
him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it
all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from,
Dumbledore’s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job — then he
might’ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you,
thanks!”

Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded
the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five
minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux
was, he was no closer to discovering where it was. . . .
Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that
it was not in Ravenclaw Tower — but if not there, where? What hiding
place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed
would remain secret forever?
Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken
only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke
open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body
flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and
furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at
Harry.

“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions
as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. “What the — ?”
“Harry, yer here! Yer here!”
Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking
hug, then ran back to the shattered window.
“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the window. “I’ll
see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!”
Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the
distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch:
It was midnight. The battle had begun.

“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?”
“Hagrid, where have you come from?”
“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid grimly.
“Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew yeh
mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we come
ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the
boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter
let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him.
Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?”
“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.”
They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them.
Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running
footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light
in the dark grounds.

“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s heels,
making the floorboards quake.
“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn, “but Ron and
Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .”
The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage
ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the
staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another
broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt
over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, don’t mind
me . . . I’ll just lie here and crumble. . . .”

Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of
Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that mad headdress —
and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her
white curls. . . .

And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone
effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head
Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot
through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.
He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .

Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have
been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the
deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick,
those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry,
had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school — here at last was a
secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered —
He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed
by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and
carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.

“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran.
“Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!”
Harry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang
galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted
figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in
armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others’ canvases,
screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of
this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase
blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of
enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.

“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great
boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the
air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone.
He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and
for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed
from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor,
screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.
“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry
Potter, see them off!”

Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of
students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another
empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands
were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.
“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry
sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another
corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris
was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them
to their proper place. . . .

“Potter!”
Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held
ready.
“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!”
“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s —”
“— attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said
Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never
occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of
Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t it have been a bit smarter
to keep ’em here?”

“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother would never
have done it.”
Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.
Your brother would never have done it . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry
thought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so
long, would never have held students ransom. . . .
And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled
relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of
large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.
“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted.
“Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron.

“Chamber — what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.
“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t it
absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if
we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t got
rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!”
“What the — ?”

“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply.
Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione’s
arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead
basilisk.

“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron.
“You need to speak Parseltongue!”
“He did!” whispered Hermione. “Show him, Ron!”
Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologetically. “I
had to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged modestly, “we got
there in the end.”

“He was amazing!” said Hermione. “Amazing!”
“So . . .” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . .”
“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket
he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione stabbed it.
Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.”
“Genius!” yelled Harry.
“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. “So
what’s new with you?”

As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them
looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.
“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said Harry,
talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where
everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one
to find it. Come on.”

As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the
concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement.
It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch
wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as
Neville’s grandmother.

“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. “You
can tell us what’s going on.”
“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together.
“’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the passage to
the Hog’s Head?”

He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were
still users inside it.
“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed it, I
think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you
seen my grandson?”

“He’s fighting,” said Harry.
“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go and assist
him.”

With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.
Harry looked at Tonks.
“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother’s?”
“I couldn’t stand not knowing —” Tonks looked anguished. “She’ll look
after him — have you seen Remus?”

“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds —”
Without another word, Tonks sped off.
“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a
bit. Then you can come back in.”
Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran up the
steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!”
“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten someone!”
“Who?” asked Hermione.

“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?”
“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.
“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out. We
don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to die for us —”
There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s
arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full
on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding
and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.

“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened
except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and
swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!”
Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.
“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit
on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or never, isn’t it?”
“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted. “D’you
think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the diadem?”

“Yeah — right — sorry —” said Ron, and he and Hermione set about
gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.

It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs,
that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the
situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling
were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest
window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the
castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place.

Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what

looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.
“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams echoed
from close by.

“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and saw
Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which
was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed
jinx into a crowd of fighters below.

“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and
Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of
students past. “They look like they might be breaching the north
battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!”

“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.
“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him since!”
“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay —”
But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.
Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were empty
words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep
safe — come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the
stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do
the bidding of the next entrant.

I need the place where everything is hidden, Harry begged of it inside his
head, and the door materialized on their third run past.
The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and
closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size
of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of
objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students.

“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing
in the silence.

“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had
to hide stuff in my time  .  .  . this way,” he added, “I think it’s down
here. . . .”
He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy had
mended last year with such disastrous consequences, then hesitated, looking
up and down aisles of junk; he could not remember where to go next. . . .

“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew
through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Gringotts, the
room would not yield its hidden objects that easily.
“Let’s split up,” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust of an old
man wearing a wig and a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard and it’s
definitely somewhere near here. . . .”

They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps
echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs,
books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . .
“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. “Somewhere  .  .  .
somewhere . . .”

Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he
recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in
his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: There it was, right ahead,
the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and
on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and
what looked like an ancient, discolored tiara.

He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away,
when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”
He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing
behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through
the small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.
“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing his own
through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.
“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand.
“Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”

“My mother,” said Draco.
Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the
situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to
have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.
“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.
“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surprisingly soft
for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak
before. Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of
sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you
to ’im.”

“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that
he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and
Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the
Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it
before the fight broke out . . .

“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them.
“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” said
Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.”
“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do
Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless grin,
“you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum!
What’s a die-dum?”

“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to
Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?”
With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot
mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and
unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”
The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next
door where Ron stood.

“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed,
and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side
of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried,
“Finite!” and it steadied.

“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat
his spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!”
“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s Potter the
Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?”

“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience
at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean —”
“‘Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity.
“Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more, Draco. You
an’ your dad are finished.”

“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall.
“What’s going on?”
“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going — no, Potter! Crucio!”
Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the
stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then
dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.
“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the
enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive —”

“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s
restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway,
what’s the diff — ?”

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around
the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It
only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.
“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to
kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who
lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it rolled
out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.
“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and
Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s hesitation was
all Harry needed.

“Expelliarmus!”
Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of
objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it;
Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell, and
Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse
at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!” again. Ron
leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wandless Malfoy
cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward
them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came.
“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk
into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go and help R —”
“HARRY!” she screamed.

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s warning. He
turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the
aisle toward them.

“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran.
But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of
abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk
bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.
“Aguamenti!” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip
of his wand evaporated in the air.
“RUN!”

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe
outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione
pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire;
Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: As they turned
a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent
upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of
fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and
rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was
thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet,
before being consumed by the inferno.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and
Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing
closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as
a wall around them.
“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the
fire. “What can we do?”

“Here!”
Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of
junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry
swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground,
they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming
raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming
overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband
of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned
experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the
room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere:
He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try
to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . .
He had never wanted this. . . .

“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was
impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the
terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.
“It’s — too — dangerous — !” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air.
His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked
the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet
charred like wood. . . .
And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle,
the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry
dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry
grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and
Malfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry’s —
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared Ron’s
voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and
Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching,
into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.

“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Harry’s ear,
and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the
billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last
few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the
creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a
sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara —
“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!”
screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem
seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward
the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist
—
Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and
straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open: Ron,
Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding
Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular
patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air
filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and
retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of
Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor
beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.

“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. “C-Crabbe . . .”
“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly.
There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of
huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures
galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their
arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and
looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear
more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.
“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was supposed to
be going back into the Room of Requirement.”

“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron, but he
too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. “Shall we
split up and look — ?”

“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained
slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. “Let’s
stick together. I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your arm?”
“What? Oh yeah —”

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot,
blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make
out the tiny words etched upon it: WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN’S GREATEST
TREASURE.

A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the
diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in
his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant
scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the
thing that had just fragmented in his fingers.

“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the
broken pieces.
“Sorry?”
“Fiendfyre — cursed fire — it’s one of the substances that destroy
Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so dangerous —
how did Crabbe know how to — ?”
“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly.
“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it,
really,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed, and whose face
was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d be quite sorry he was
dead.”

“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we can
just get the snake —”
But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of
dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to
fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed
into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every
direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped
and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair —
“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at
Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes,
apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”
“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling
collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse
had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed
to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.
“You actually are joking, Perce.  .  .  . I don’t think I’ve heard you joke
since you were —”

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron,
Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned,
the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger
seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself
flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to
that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his
head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without
a hope of knowing what had happened to them —
And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was
half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a
terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown
away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding
copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that
expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood
up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened,
perhaps, than he had been in his life. . . .

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three
redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted
apart. Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered and stumbled over
stone and wood.
“No — no — no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!”
And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them,
and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched
upon his face.


CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

THE ELDER WAND

he world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen
silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s
mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the
impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all
his senses must be lying —
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and
curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their
heads.

“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He
and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy
lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry
shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head.
“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s face as
he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not
budge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re going to —”
Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A
monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the
huge hole in the wall: One of Aragog’s descendants had joined the fight.
Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster
was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the
darkness.

“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of
the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant
spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden
Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired
Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its
fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then
more curses came soaring over Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of
them blow his hair.

“Let’s move, NOW!”
Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred’s
body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do,
stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid
the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.
“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor
had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he
had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off
after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of
the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long
gone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and
forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner,
Percy let out a bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the
direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.
“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed.

She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling
together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing
again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him
running after Percy.

“Listen to me — LISTEN, RON!”
“I wanna help — I wanna kill Death Eaters —”
His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was
shaking with rage and grief.
“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please — Ron — we need the
snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione.

But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring
the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the
people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and
above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not — but he could
not permit that idea to form in his mind —
“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake! But
let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing! We’re the
only ones who can end it!”

She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve
as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still
keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.
“You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the snake
with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry — look inside him!”

Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours,
yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her
command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant
sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he
stood far, far away from them. . . .
He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room,
with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one.

The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single
unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood,
but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.

He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his thoughts on
the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room,
like the Chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to
discover. . . . He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem . . .
although Dumbledore’s puppet had come much farther than he had ever
expected . . . too far. . . .

“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: There was
Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the
marks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last escape. One of
his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord . . . please . . . my son . . .”
“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join
me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry
Potter?”

“No — never,” whispered Malfoy.
“You must hope not.”
“Aren’t — aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at another
hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t it be  .  .  .
forgive me . . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek
him y-yourself?”
“Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can
discover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter.
Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.”
Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It
troubled him . . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to
be rearranged. . . .

“Go and fetch Snape.”
“Snape, m-my Lord?”
“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a — service — I require from him.
Go.”

Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room.
Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers,
staring at it.

“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and
there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting
gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a
starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.
With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment
his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs
of battle.

“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of
magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”
“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.
“He’s not — he’s not even fighting?”
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to
go to him.”

“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him
— obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —”
“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what
he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and
I’ll go and get it —”
Harry cut across Ron.
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I
—”
“No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and
—”

“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.
Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as capable —” the
tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.
“POTTER!”

Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were
fully raised, Hermione shouted, “Glisseo!”
The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and
Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death
Eaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the
concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the
opposite wall.

“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there
were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the
Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.

“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione flattened
themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past,
shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to
notice them: Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek.
As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, “CHARGE!”

“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind us —”
But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted
anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the
air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.

They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full
of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with
figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both
masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself
a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the
duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong
likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they
stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great
“Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over
them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads
were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.
“Argh!”

A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy green
roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them
loose.

“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing.
Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distraction,
knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and
Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.

“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the
Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst
of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top
of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!”

Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death
Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked
around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the
Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding,
utterly bemused.

“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you two-faced
bastard!” Ron yelled.
There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters
everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with
Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them.
Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends.
Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed
but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls
of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest
Death Eater and began reeling him in.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass
shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House
points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered
as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the
ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged
across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.

“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand,
Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of
Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his
feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of
his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.
“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters.
“More for any who want them! Here —”

And with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous
crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the
ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same
moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic
spiders forced their way into the entrance hall.

Screams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, Death Eaters and
Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the
oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.
“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before
either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had
come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.
“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled.

“HAGRID, NO!”
Harry forgot everything else: He sprinted out from under the Cloak,
running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.
“HAGRID, COME BACK!”

But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid
vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming
movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in
their midst.
“HAGRID!”

Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did
not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and
the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing
of Hagrid at all.
“HAGRID!”

He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst
of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was
impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and
made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood
before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its
treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one
brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window,
and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the
doorway.

“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry
and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the
window above.
“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her
wand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —”
“HAGGER?”

Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry
realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan
monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out
a roar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and
Grawp’s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth;
and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.

“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as
the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps
into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of
finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the
forest before they were brought up short again.

The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and solidified in
his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of
concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave toward the castle, their
faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . .
Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind
them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors
could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and
Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . . .

“Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way away.
“Patronuses, Harry, come on!”
He raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him:
How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he felt as though
his soul had already half left his body. . . .
“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione.
A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their
way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a promise of a feast. . . .
He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he
saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade; and his own wand trembled
in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of
nothing, of no feeling. . . .

And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and
Hermione’s heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures’ approach.
Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them,
their wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie,
and Seamus.

“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the
Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A.
“That’s right, Harry . . . come on, think of something happy. . . .”
“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked.
“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come on,
now. . . .”

There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the
greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of Harry’s
wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and
immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding
battle were loud in his ears.

“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and
Seamus, “you just saved —”
With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out
of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller
than any of them.

“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: They all
scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature’s vast
foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round:
Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished
back into the battle.

“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and
its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red
and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.
“The Whomping Willow,” said Harry, “go!”

Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space
into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his
terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must
all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort,
because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it —
He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the
jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake
crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the
night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen
in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he
who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots
with whiplike, slashing branches.

Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow’s swiping
branches, peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk, trying to see
the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and
Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.
“How — how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can — see the place
— if we just had — Crookshanks again —”

“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest.
“Are you a wizard, or what?”
“Oh — right — yeah —”
Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and
said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig flew up from the ground, spun
through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the
trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a
place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still.
“Perfect!” panted Hermione.
“Wait.”

For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled
the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to
come . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?
But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only
way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,
and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .

“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a
much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The
tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it
nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl.
Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet
barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon
the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist.

At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light
ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his
free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, “Nox,”
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as
silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be
discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light.

And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them,
only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel
had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to
breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap
left between crate and wall.

The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and
coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere,
which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a
long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and
Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched,
hidden.

“. . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling —”
“— and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his high,
clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will
make much difference now. We are almost there . . . almost.”
“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my
Lord. Please.”

Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes
fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might
penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything.
One failed attempt, and he would give away his position. . . .
Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the
flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the
semidarkness.

“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly.
“My Lord?” said Snape.
Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as
a conductor’s baton.
“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”
In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as
it coiled and uncoiled — or was it Voldemort’s sibilant sigh lingering on the
air?

“My — my Lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand. You — you
have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.”
“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am
extraordinary, but this wand . . . no. It has not revealed the wonders it has
promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured
from Ollivander all those years ago.”

Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun to throb
and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that
controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.
“No difference,” said Voldemort again.
Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered whether
Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his
master.

Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for
seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the
pain and fury mounted in Harry.
“I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why I have
called you back from the battle?”

And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile: His eyes were fixed upon
the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.
“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.”
“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He
does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his weakness, you
see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around
him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any
cost. He will come.”

“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself
—”
“My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture
Potter. Kill his friends — the more, the better — but do not kill him.
“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You
have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.”

“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But — let me go and find the
boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can —”

“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red
in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the
slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar.
“My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally
meet the boy!”

“My Lord, there can be no question, surely — ?”
“— but there is a question, Severus. There is.”
Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the
Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.
“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry
Potter?”

“I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.”
“Can’t you?”
The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: He forced
his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He
closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale
face.

“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to
kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the
twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so, but Lucius’s wand
shattered upon meeting Potter’s.”
“I — I have no explanation, my Lord.”

Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed
upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
“I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny,
the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of
Albus Dumbledore.”

And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death
mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to
see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.
“My Lord — let me go to the boy —”
“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,”
said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering,
wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to
perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner . . . and I think
I have the answer.”

Snape did not speak.
“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus.
You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.”
“My Lord —”

“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its
true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last
owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder
Wand cannot be truly mine.”
“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand.
“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the wand,
Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”
And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to
Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But
then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s cage was rolling
through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had
encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
“Kill.”

There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the little color
it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs
pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his
knees gave way and he fell to the floor.
“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly.

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to
leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full
bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted
upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from
the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a
backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge
protective sphere.

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had
drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now
he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a
foot in a black boot trembling on the floor.
“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his
wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted
sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the
room.

He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying
man: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the
fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the
Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening
black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and
Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close.
A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat.
“Take . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .”

Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue,
neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes,
and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do —
A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by
Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When
the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no
blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened.

“Look . . . at . . . me. . . .” he whispered.
The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the
depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and
empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no
more.


CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

THE PRINCE’S TALE

arry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring down at him,
until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that
Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that
Voldemort had reentered the room.

Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry
realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area,
that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle
would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back
of their necks, a deathblow away.

“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Voldemort
knows how to value bravery.
“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you
will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical
blood spilled is a loss and a waste.

“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat
immediately.
“You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your
injured.

“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your
friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour
in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to
me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall
enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish
every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me.
One hour.”

Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.
“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron.
“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s — let’s get back to the
castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new plan —”
She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance.
Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked
down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way
Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . . .
They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry
wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in
their heads, as he could.

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me
yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest . . . One hour. . . .
Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could
only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them
hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay
abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his
attacker.

The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no
bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall
were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor,
along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had
been blown away.

“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione.
Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.
The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors
stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks. The injured were
being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of
helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he
shook where he lay, unable to stand.

The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see
Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his
head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her body shaking, Mr.
Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.
Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw
Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug
her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron’s
shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family,
Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks,
pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark,
enchanted ceiling.

The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry
reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not
bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He
could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if
he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died. . . .
He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks  .  .  . He
yearned not to feel . . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards,
everything that was screaming inside him. . . .

The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined
the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching
the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he
reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?”
“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he
yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the
spiral staircase behind.

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The
portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster
or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away,
charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have
a clear view of what was going on.

Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung
directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone
Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto
the desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic
markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a
blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than
his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and
without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this
would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.

He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he
straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A
single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were
swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from
behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were
so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge
coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.
Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten
years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin
face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher
than her sister.

“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.
But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown
into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great
shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she
soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing
far too lightly.

“Mummy told you not to!”
Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the
ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.
“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”
“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch what I
can do.”

Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from
themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up
a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia
advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited
until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm.
The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre,
many-lipped oyster.

“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.
“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom
and threw it back to the ground.
“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight
to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and
there was definite longing in her voice.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself, but had
jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward
toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she
was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted
the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.
“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.

Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant
Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I
know what you are.”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape.
She looked affronted.
“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”
She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.
“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why
he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did
not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking
ludicrously batlike, like his older self.
The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one
of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.
“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watching you
for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a
wizard.”

Petunia’s laugh was like cold water.
“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered
from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know who you are. You’re
that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily,
and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor
recommendation. “Why have you been spying on us?”
“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirtyhaired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added
spitefully, “you’re a Muggle.”
Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly
mistake the tone.

“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at
once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched
through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him,
recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had
been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . .
The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him.
He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering
through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool
green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the
ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less
peculiar in the half light.

“. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you
get letters.”
“But I have done magic outside school!”
“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when you’re
a kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nodded importantly,
“and they start training you, then you’ve got to go careful.”
There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it
in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it.
Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It is real,
isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there
isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?”
“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you
and me.”

“Really?” whispered Lily.
“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd
clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her,
brimful of confidence in his destiny.
“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.
“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so someone from the
school will have to come and explain to your parents.”
“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?”
Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over
the pale face, the dark red hair.

“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”
“Good,” said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had been worrying.
“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time I was
watching you . . .”

His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the
leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He
watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.
“How are things at your house?” Lily asked.
A little crease appeared between his eyes.
“Fine,” he said.

“They’re not arguing anymore?”
“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves
and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing.
“But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.”
“Doesn’t your dad like magic?”

“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape.
“Severus?”
A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name.
“Yeah?”
“Tell me about the dementors again.”
“What d’you want to know about them for?”
“If I use magic outside school —”
“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for
people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban.
You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re too —”
He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling
noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost
her footing.

“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had
jumped to his feet.
“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”
Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her
struggling for something hurtful to say.
“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s
chest. “Your mum’s blouse?”
There was a crack: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily
screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered
backward and burst into tears.

“Tuney!”
But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
“Did you make that happen?”
“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.
“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did! You hurt her!”
“No — no I didn’t!”
But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran
from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and
confused. . . .

And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on platform nine
and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a
thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape
was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a
little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister;
Harry moved closer to listen.

“. . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen —” She caught her sister’s hand
and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. “Maybe once
I’m there — no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to
Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!”
“I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand
back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some stupid castle
and learn to be a — a —”

Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their
owners’ arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages,
over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks
onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries
after a summer apart.
“— you think I want to be a — a freak?”
Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand
away.

“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.”
“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school
for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that’s what you two are. It’s
good you’re being separated from normal people. It’s for our safety.”
Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform
with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she
looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce.
“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to the
headmaster and begged him to take you.”

Petunia turned scarlet.
“Beg? I didn’t beg!”
“I saw his reply. It was very kind.”
“You shouldn’t have read —” whispered Petunia, “that was my private
— how could you — ?”
Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood
nearby. Petunia gasped.
“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!”
“No — not sneaking —” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus saw
the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have contacted
Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in
the postal service who take care of —”

“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia, now
as pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister, and she
flounced off to where her parents stood. . . .
The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the
Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already
changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to
take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a
compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a
corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the
windowpane.

Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She
glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been
crying.
“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice.
“Why not?”
“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.”
“So what?”

She threw him a look of deep dislike.
“So she’s my sister!”
“She’s only a —” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to
wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.
“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his
voice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.
“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had
brightened a little.

“Slytherin?”
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at
all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry,
whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window,
saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air
of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously
lacked.

“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James
asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry
realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.
“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.
“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”
Sirius grinned.

“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the
choice?”
James lifted an invisible sword.
“‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.”
Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him.
“Got a problem with that?”
“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d rather
be brawny than brainy —”
“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected Sirius.
James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from
James to Sirius in dislike.
“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”
“Oooooo . . .”

James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he
passed.
“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door
slammed. . . .
And the scene dissolved once more. . . .
Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House
tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, “Evans,
Lily!”

He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down
upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto
her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat
cried, “Gryffindor!”

Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it
back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering
Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad
little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room
for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train,
folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him.

The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father
join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen
students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.
Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his
head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.

And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from
Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a
prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat
down beside him. . . .
And the scene changed. . . .

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently
arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached
them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to
have passed since their Sorting.
“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying. “Best
friends?”

“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round
with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you
see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary
Macdonald the other day?”
Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin,
sallow face.

“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all —”
“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny —”
“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded Snape.
His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his
resentment.

“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.
“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that Lupin.
Where does he keep going?”
“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill —”
“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.
“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are you so
obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at
night?”

“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems
to think they are.”
The intensity of his gaze made her blush.
“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice. “And
you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You
went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James
Potter saved you from whatever’s down there —”
Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved? You
think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too!
You’re not going to — I won’t let you —”
“Let me? Let me?”

Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.
“I didn’t mean — I just don’t want to see you made a fool of — He
fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched from
him against his will. “And he’s not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch
hero —” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and
Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.
“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting across
Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and Avery’s idea of
humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with
them.”

Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and
Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had
relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape’s
step. . . .
And the scene dissolved. . . .
Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L.
in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the
castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree
where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his
distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted
Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said,
and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again . . . He watched as Lily joined
the group and went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at
her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.”

The scene changed. . . .
“I’m sorry.”
“I’m not interested.”
“I’m sorry!”
“Save your breath.”
It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her
arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to
Gryffindor Tower.
“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep
here.”
“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just
—”

“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve made
excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even
talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends — you see, you
don’t even deny it! You don’t even deny that’s what you’re all aiming to be!
You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?”
He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.
“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.”

“No — listen, I didn’t mean —”
“— to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood,
Severus. Why should I be any different?”
He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she
turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . .
The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-form:
Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his
surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in
the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless
trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped
tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone  .  .  . His fear
infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and
he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting
for —

Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry
thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had
flown out of his hand.
“Don’t kill me!”
“That was not my intention.”
Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of
the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping
around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his
wand.

“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?”
“No — no message — I’m here on my own account!”
Snape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his straggling
black hair flying around him.
“I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please —”
Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew
through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and
Snape faced each other.

“What request could a Death Eater make of me?”
“The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .”
“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord
Voldemort?”

“Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why — it is for
that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!”
“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It spoke of
a boy born at the end of July —”

“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt
her down — kill them all —”
“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord
Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in
exchange for the son?”

“I have — I have asked him —”
“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much
contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. “You do not care,
then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as
you have what you want?”

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.
“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her — them — safe. Please.”
“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”
“In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him
to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”
The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and
something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was
slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him,
looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked
like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild
hilltop.

“I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .”
“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dumbledore.
“Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would
spare her?”

Snape’s breathing was shallow.
“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.
With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.
“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the
shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”
“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone . . . dead . . .”
“Is this remorse, Severus?”

“I wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .”
“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore coldly. “If
you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is
clear.”

Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s words
appeared to take a long time to reach him.
“What — what do you mean?”
“You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me
protect Lily’s son.”

“He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone —”
“The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger
when he does.”
There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself,
mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very well. But
never — never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I
cannot bear . . . especially Potter’s son . . . I want your word!”
“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?”
Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished face.
“If you insist . . .”

The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and
down in front of Dumbledore.
“— mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted
to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent —”
“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, without
raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. “Other teachers
report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I
find him an engaging child.”

Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye
on Quirrell, won’t you?”
A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and
Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers
from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.
“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.
“Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears
retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark
Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore’s crooked-nosed profile.
“Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.”

“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies
came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted to join him?”
“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating
figures. “I am not such a coward.”

“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor
Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . .”
He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . .
And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It was
nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind
the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side,
blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand
at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of
thick golden potion down Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two,
Dumbledore’s eyelids fluttered and opened.

“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on that ring? It
carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”
Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was
cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
Dumbledore grimaced.
“I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”
“Tempted by what?”
Dumbledore did not answer.

“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious.
“That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can
hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being —”
Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the
expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?”
Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a
weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a
year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is
the sort of curse that strengthens over time.”

Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed
a matter of little or no concern to him.
“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”
“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to
do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously. He looked down at the
broken ring and the sword. “Did you think that breaking the ring would
break the curse?”

“Something like that  .  .  . I was delirious, no doubt  .  .  .  .” said
Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. “Well,
really, this makes matters much more straightforward.”
Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.
“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to
have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”

Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk
from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the
subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite
refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, “The Dark Lord
does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius’s
recent failures. Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail
and pay the price.”

“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as
surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought the
natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”
There was a short pause.
“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”
“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not
need a spy at Hogwarts?”

“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”
“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed,
as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect
the students of Hogwarts?”
Snape gave a stiff nod.
“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up
to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself.
Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you —”
“— much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks
I have usurped Lucius’s position.”

“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental
victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course,
there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord
Voldemort’s wrath.”
Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, “Are
you intending to let him kill you?”
“Certainly not. You must kill me.”
There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes
the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.
“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy with
irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?”
“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the moment
will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,” he
indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it will happen within a
year.”

“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do
it?”
“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not
have it ripped apart on my account.”
“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”
“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid
pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one great favor of you,
Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons
will finish bottom of this year’s league. I confess I should prefer a quick,
painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance,
Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear
Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.”
His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently
pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last
Snape gave another curt nod.

Dumbledore seemed satisfied.
“Thank you, Severus . . .”
The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling
together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.
“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted
together?” Snape asked abruptly.

Dumbledore looked weary.
“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy
will soon have spent more time in detention than out.”
“He is his father over again —”

“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother’s.
I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him,
information I must give him before it is too late.”
“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him . . . you do not trust me.”
“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is
essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he
needs to do.”

“And why may I not have the same information?”
“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a
basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.”
“Which I do on your orders!”
“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the
constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort
what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is
a job I would entrust to nobody but you.”
“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency,
whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark
Lord’s mind!”

“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so long ago he
had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was
pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry
again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a
soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame —”
“Souls? We were talking of minds!”

“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of
the other.”
Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They
were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone
near them.
“After you have killed me, Severus —”
“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of
me!” snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. “You take a
great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!”
“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about
services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our
young Slytherin friend?”

Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.
“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not
complain that I have no confidence in you. . . .”
They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes
sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him,
talking.

“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary,
otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?”
“But what must he do?”
“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will
come a time — after my death — do not argue, do not interrupt! There will
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his
snake.”

“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical
protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”

Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily
cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded
upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart
from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that
collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that
which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with
Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected
by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.”

Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel,
they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears.
“So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.
“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”
Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought . . . all these years . . .
that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.”

“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to
raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight
shut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a
parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know
him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his
death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.”
Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.
“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”
“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you
watched die?”

“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up.
“You have used me.”
“Meaning?”
“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for
you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now
you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter —”
“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you
grown to care for the boy, after all?”
“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”
From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office
floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window.
Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned
back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.
“After all this time?”
“Always,” said Snape.

And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of
Dumbledore behind his desk.
“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure
from his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so will raise
suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you
must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry’s safety.
Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to
take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly  .  .  . I am
counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as
possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .”
Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern,
Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in
concentration.

“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that
they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing that
might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as
your own idea. You understand?”
“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . .
Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear
dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead
were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . . A Death Eater moved
ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin’s back —
“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.

But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed and hit
George instead —
And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were
dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily.
The second page carried only a few words:
could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her
mind’s going, personally!
Lots of love,
Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it
inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding,
so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion
showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of
drawers. . . .

And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas
Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait.
“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood
—”
“Do not use that word!”
“— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag
and I heard her!”
“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the
headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be
taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you
give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for him
—”

“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore
and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it
from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.
“And you still aren’t going to tell me why it’s so important to give Potter
the sword?” said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes.
“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait. “He will know what
to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to
your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap —”
Snape turned at the door.

“Don’t worry, Dumbledore,” he said coolly. “I have a plan. . . .”
And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and
moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape
might just have closed the door.


CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR

THE FOREST AGAIN

inally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of
the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of
victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His
job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms. Along the way, he
was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he
flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend
himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in
Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could
survive.

He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his
dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it
would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would
there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time,
out into the grounds and into the forest?
Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum
pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought
that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the
thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear
of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun
Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself:
dying.

If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had left
number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix-feather
wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he
would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched
himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved. . . . He envied even
his parents’ deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction
would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling
slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him;
the portraits on the walls were all empty.
Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and
more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never
appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It
would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came
slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were
his eyes.

Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a
bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that
now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted
him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by
how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the
job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip
away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat,
how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to
the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would
not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.

And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he
would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had
taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumbledore knew, as
Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that
he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin,
and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his
mind’s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was
impatient. . . .

But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake
survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after
Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody.
He wondered who would do it . . . Ron and Hermione would know what
needed to be done, of course. . . . That would have been why Dumbledore
wanted him to confide in two others  .  .  . so that if he fulfilled his true
destiny a little early, they could carry on. . . .

Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard
surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die.
It must end.
Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt
as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes
and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they
could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him
would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he
had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by
Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.

He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird.
Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a
lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office
door.

The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he
had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames;
the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were
concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were
crammed.

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through
the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped,
but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front
doors easily.

Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was
carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another
dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have
sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in
death.

“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver Wood,
and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and carried him
into the Great Hall.
Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his
forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set
off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.
Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People
were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling
beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of
Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he
would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at
them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was
better like this.

He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in
the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they
were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.
Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.
“Neville.”

“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”
Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of
nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.
“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously.
“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got to do.
Listen — Neville —”

“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not thinking of
handing yourself over?”
“No,” Harry lied easily. “’Course not  .  .  . this is something else. But I
might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake, Neville?
He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . .”
“I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?”
“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they
—”

The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it
impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was
crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there
were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three
people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry’s
place: There would still be three in the secret.
“Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance —”
“Kill the snake?”

“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated.
“All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?”
“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.”
But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.
“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”
“Yeah, I —”

The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could
not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the
shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.
Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else
was moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground.
He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny.
He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was
whispering for her mother.
“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get you
inside.”

“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to fight
anymore!”
“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all right.”
Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout out to
the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to
know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to
be sent back home. . . .
But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.
He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home
here. . . .

Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a
huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around
as he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking
nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back.
Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound
of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those
visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock
cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs,
and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . .

He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped.
A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their
chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had
no strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own
trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the
smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that
people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he
was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not
be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the
Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . .
The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch
at his neck and he pulled it out.

I open at the close.
Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to
move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding
was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close.
This was the moment.
He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am about to
die.”

The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s
wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”
The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the
two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the
vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle
representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.
And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter
about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really
fetching them: They were fetching him.

He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times.
He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around
him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twigstrewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes
and looked around.

They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They
resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long
ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than
living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on
each face, there was the same loving smile.

James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes
in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses
were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s.
Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen
him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin
on his face.

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker
and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so
many adolescent wanderings.
Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew
close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as
though she would never be able to look at him enough.
“You’ve been so brave.”

He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he
would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.
“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so proud of
you.”

“Does it hurt?”
The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could stop it.
“Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.”
“And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin.
“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without his
volition. “Any of you. I’m sorry —”

He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him.
“— right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry —”
“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him . . . but he
will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a
world in which he could live a happier life.”
A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted
the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it
would have to be his decision.

“You’ll stay with me?”
“Until the very end,” said James.
“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.
“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.”
Harry looked at his mother.
“Stay close to me,” he said quietly.

And he set off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him; he passed
through it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and
together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their
branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched
the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper
into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he
would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James,
Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason
he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working
without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the
body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the
forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle:
Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts
as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . .
A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by.
Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother
and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.

“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got an
Invisibility Cloak. Could it be — ?”
Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and
Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the
place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently
they could not see anything.

“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you reckon?”
“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said
Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.
Yaxley looked down at his watch.

“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.”
“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.”
“Better go back,” said Yaxley. “Find out what the plan is now.”
He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry
followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted
to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father
nodded encouragement.

They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and
Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been
the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his
vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had
been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause.

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell
over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them
were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on
the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their
faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his
long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw
Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose
eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.

Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed,
and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might
have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing
still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a
game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great
snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.

Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in
the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.
“My Lord —”
Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a
little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another
word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.

“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his
eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.”
Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now
throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he
was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled off the
Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did
not want to be tempted to fight.

“I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort.
“You weren’t.”
Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He
did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between
his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents,
Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that
moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of
them.

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the
Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter.
Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and
he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between
them.

Then a voice yelled: “HARRY! NO!”
He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His
massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.
“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH — ?”
“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was
silenced.

Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort
to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames
and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind
Voldemort’s head.

Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to
draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he
managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And
still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted
his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a
singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.
“Harry Potter,” he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the
spitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.”

None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was
waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry
thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips
on his —Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a
curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked
back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could
still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear —
He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was
gone.


CHAPTER  SIX

THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK

rs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she said as they
reached the first landing. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s
asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.”
“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade
them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. “If Ginny’s not
lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said
downstairs, then I’m a flobberworm . . .“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing,
pointing them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.”
“’Night,” Harry and Ron said to the twins.

“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking.
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The
bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first
sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and
deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his
pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron
threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and
Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.
“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron explained as he pulled
on his maroon pajamas. “Dumbledore doesn’t want too many owls
swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh yeah  .  .  . I
forgot . . .”

He crossed to the door and bolted it.
“What’re you doing that for?”
“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was here he
came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don’t want to
wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway . . .” He got
into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in
the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in
through the grimy window. “What d’you reckon?”
Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.

“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?” he
said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all they’ve
really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining Vol —”
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
“— demort ,”said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using his
name? Sirius and Lupin do.”
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” he said. “We
already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable
Ears. The only new bit was —”

Crack.
“OUCH!”
“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.”
“You two just Apparated on my knees!”
“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —”
Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from
Ron’s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress descended
a few inches as George sat down near his feet.
“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly.
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry.

“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. “We
didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?”
“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
“Could be anything,” said Fred.
“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can
there?” said Ron. “What’s worse than death?”
“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once,” suggested
George.

“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said Ron
fearfully.
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said Harry. “He doesn’t
need anything more efficient than that.”
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
“So who d’you think’s got it now?” asked George.
“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred.
“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?”

“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said Ron.
“Not necessarily,” said Fred.
“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. “Look at Ginny.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry.
“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes,
have you?”

“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!”
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and
Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later
and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was
plainly listening to see whether they were talking or not.
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again
and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.

“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been
so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for
hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs.
Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone
he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs  .  .  . In fact, manylegged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom
door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying,
“Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be studyin’ weapons this term . . .”
And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling
to face him. . . . He ducked. . . .

The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his
bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room.
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs
you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought and
she’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.”
Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted
quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first
floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled
little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long,
moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible
bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and
George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths
over their noses and mouths. Each of them was also holding a large bottle
of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.

“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron
the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid
standing on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve never seen an
infestation this bad — what that house-elf’s been doing for the last ten years
—”

Hermione’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly
saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these words.
“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —”
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to,
Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feeding
Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .”
He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine
the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking
slightly.

“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering
through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at
it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much
worse.”

“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry
quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night
before.

A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the
cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night
by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.
“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperatedly,
hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs
as Mrs. Black’s screeches echoed up through the house once more: “Stains
of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth . . .”
“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room door; he
wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously
managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because she had
stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the
clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he
recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s just relieved me, so
she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for
Dumbledore . . .”

Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully
closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy
Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.
“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their
teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody
needed it.”

She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains,
and beckoned them all forward.
“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said. “They’ll
come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will
paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.”
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray.
“All right — squirt!”

Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy
came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring,
tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black
hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face
with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud
thunk, onto the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the
bucket.

“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. “Spray that at
once and throw it away!”
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his
forefinger and thumb.
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so
that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he pocketed
it with a wink.

“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,”
George told Harry under his breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose,
Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth,
“What are Skiving Snackboxes?”
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a wary
eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get
you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing
them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the
orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been
rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half
—”

“‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure
activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been
devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re putting in the adverts,
anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line
of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and
adding them to his pocket. “But they still need a bit of work. At the moment
our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to
swallow the purple end.”

“Testers?”
“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies —
we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —”
“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George.
“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the
nozzle on his spray.

“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred, dropping
his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf
before returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mail-order service at
the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.”
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum hasn’t
got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling
lies about you and Dumbledore.”

Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousandGalleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them
realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that
his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not
think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.
The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past
midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into
a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on
the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp
and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in
the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which
Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting
covetous looks.

“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.”
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on
either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment
of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number
of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not
understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large
opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.
“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Black’s
screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up some
sandwiches.”

She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once,
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. They
could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously
balanced cauldrons.
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all those cauldrons
for?”

“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t that
what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up
dodgy cauldrons?”
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus
heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. “Blimey, Mum
won’t like that . . .”
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently.
Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again.
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred muttered, frowning
with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon we can risk the
Extendable Ears?”
“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak upstairs and get a pair
—”

But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from
downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them
could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.
“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!”
“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a
satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs.
Weasley’s voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a nice change.”
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T GOT
ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN
CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —”

“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking his
head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of
steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go at
Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be
following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —”
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the
portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but
before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was
completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times
too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a
quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a
bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large and rather
snoutlike.

The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though
it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward
the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all the while in a hoarse,
deep voice like a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot,
but she’s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my
Mistress’s house, oh my poor Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum
they’ve let in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame
of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old
Kreacher, what can he do . . .”

“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.
The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave a very
pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and
bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, “Nasty
little brat of a blood traitor it is.”
“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.”
“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second bow to George,
adding in a clear undertone, “and there’s its twin, unnatural little beasts they
are.”

Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up,
eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they
could not hear him as he continued to mutter.
“.  .  .  and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my
Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher doesn’t
know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t know . . .”
“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. “Harry Potter.”
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously
than ever.

“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if
Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say —”
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in his right mind, he
doesn’t know what he’s —”
“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying,” said
Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true,
that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it
—”

“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred.
“What do you want anyway?” George asked.
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George.
“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively.
“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The
noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had
moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius,
Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his
snoutlike nose on the floor.

“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, what are you up to?”
“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the
noble house of Black —”
“— and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius.
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again, and
continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who
broke his mother’s heart —”
“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She kept
herself alive out of pure spite.”

Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then muttered
furiously, “Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother’s boots, oh my
poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how
she hated him, what a disappointment he was —”
“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time you
show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room
so we can’t throw it out.”

“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master’s
house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would never forgive
Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been in the
family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood
traitors and the brats destroy it —”
“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the
opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the
back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go
away, Kreacher.”

It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless,
the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest
loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.
“— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my poor
Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it,
her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he’s back,
they say he’s a murderer too —”

“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius irritably, and he
slammed the door shut on the elf.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I don’t
think he realizes we can hear him.”
“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from my
mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little —”
“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, “maybe —”
“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,” said Sirius
curtly. “And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he
leaves this house, see how he takes it.”

Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had been
trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.
The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though
doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread with which
it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling
family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages.
Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:
THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“TOUJOURS PUR”

“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree.
“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole
in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother blasted
me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering
the story under his breath.”
“You ran away from home?”

“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.”
“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.
“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good
about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at
your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got
a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold —
he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why — anyway, after that I
looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter’s for
Sunday lunch, though.”
“But . . . why did you . . . ?”

“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, unkempt
hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pureblood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . .
my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that’s him.”
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name REGULUS
BLACK. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of
birth.

“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as I was
constantly reminded.”
“But he died,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind
of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily.
“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?”
“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they
were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggleborns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone either, there
were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who
thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they
saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents
thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.”
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.

“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on
Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important
enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he
died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do
and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your resignation to
Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”

“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice.
She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray
loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face
and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food,
but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.
“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my greatgreat-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had  .  .  .
and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to force through
a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal  .  .  . and dear Aunt
Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when
they got too old to carry tea trays  .  .  . of course, anytime the family
produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on
here. Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s
supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.

“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said Sirius,
examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look
—”

He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names,
Bellatrix and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable
pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks,
so —”

Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and
 laughed sourly.
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the
right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked
Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from
their names led to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”

“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very
limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage
and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed. But there’s
no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood
traitors it’s the Weasleys.”
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s burn:
Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus
Lestrange.

“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his
memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn’t think
where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his
stomach.
“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him curiously.
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch,
Junior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother,
Rabastan, was with them too.”

And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside
Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories
could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood
at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her
pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction
that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.
“You never said she was your —”

“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m
concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I haven’t
seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in
to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like her?”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was just surprised, that’s
all —”

“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He turned
away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t like being
back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I never thought I’d
be stuck in this house again.”

Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if forced,
when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place forever, to
return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. “My father put every
security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s
Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d have
wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protection, you’d be hard
put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the
Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them
personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was
from Dumbledore . . .” Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. “If my parents
could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait
should give you some idea . . .”
He scowled for a moment, then sighed.

“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something
useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing —
as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support, what
d’you think?”

Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He
had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening;
in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, of hearing
everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius’s
words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at
Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought
how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.
“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had
been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely
something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use
magic to save your own life.”

“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back here and
live with you?”
Sirius smiled sadly.
“We’ll see.”
“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go back
to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him.
“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily.
“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley
called.

Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he
and Harry went to join the others.
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the
glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required
a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant
to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver
snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant
crusty covering like a tough brown glove.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it
lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap
powder in there.”

He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the
debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in
a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a
many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider
when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius seized it
and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding
Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling
tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak
and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy
locket that none of them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a
dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s
grandfather for “Services to the Ministry.”

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously,
throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.
Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle
things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they
caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black
crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the
room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never
heard before.

“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack.
“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught
him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.”
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only
undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which
resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing
desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be
sure what was inside it.

They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor
where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left
the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a
half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown
unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old
photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed
shrilly as the glass covering them smashed.

Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they
were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good
fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing
wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more
offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish
sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed
him with a watery stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,”
before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn
Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he
is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors
and scum . . .”

At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by the
back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s
mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to
eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief
glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs.
Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house
several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never came face-to-face;
he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall,
looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too
busy to linger.

Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a
memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in
an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but
who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped
them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of
shooting heavy bolts at passersby. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in
Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes
that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.

Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about
corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing
to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was
happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or
lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the
thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his
insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he
was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud,
not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering
together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not
mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing
him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and
ordering him back to the Dursleys’  .  .  . but he would not go. He was
determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live
with Sirius.

He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs.
Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said
quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I
want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression can work
wonders.”

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked
over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth
had become so dry he could not chew.
“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound
unconcerned.

“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs.
Weasley had answered it.

“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to go
with you, and I must say I —”
“— think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips.
“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, staring at Sirius.
“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his own
eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the
eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if that were
possible, even worse.


CHAPTER  SEVEN

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

arry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments
he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of
his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses.
Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot
of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall
sniggered again.

Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast
asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the
landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the
next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students
at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of
Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.

He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door
he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it
open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there
almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except
Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt
to her feet the moment he entered.

“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the
fire.
“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly
this morning. “Sleep all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another shuddering yawn.
“Come and sit down . . .”
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge? Muffins?
Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying about
Scrimgeour?”

“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking
Kingsley and me funny questions . . .”
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of
pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like
chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing
with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the
shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.
“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomorrow, I’m
just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to
finish anyway . . .”

Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pin-striped
trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.
“How are you feeling?”
Harry shrugged.
“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In a few hours’ time
you’ll be cleared.”
Harry said nothing.
“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll be
questioning you.”
“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair, she’ll
hear you out.”
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be polite and stick to the
facts.”

Harry nodded again.
“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even underage wizards are
allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.”
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s neck; for a
moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him
again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet
comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately.
Harry shook his head.
Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be
better off there than hanging around here.”
“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his
feet.

“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for
you . . .”
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him.
“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said.
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later then.”
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley
unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry asked him, as they set
off briskly around the square.

“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but obviously you can’t,
and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion  .  .  .
makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for . . .”
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew
it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost
deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station
they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he
found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily
business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.
“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.”

“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign.
“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them.
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry
handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle
money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train
that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept
anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the
windows.

“Four stops, Harry  .  .  . three stops left now  .  .  . two stops to go,
Harry . . .”
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train
in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator
they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way
the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with
imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic.

“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping
moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr.
Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, “Ah
yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down a side road.
“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all looks rather
different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never even
used the visitor’s entrance before.”

The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings
became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather
shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had
expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red
telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a
heavily graffittied wall. “After you, Harry.”

He opened the telephone box door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr.
Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight
fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging
crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr.
Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” Harry said.
“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above
his head and peering at the dial. “Let’s see  .  .  . six  .  .  .” he dialed the
number, “two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .”
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice
sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley’s
hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing
right beside them.

“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and
business.”
“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into
the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear,
“Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry
Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing . . .”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, please take the badge
and attach it to the front of your robes.”

There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the
metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was
a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He
pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at
the far end of the Atrium.”

The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into
the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the
glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads.
Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as
the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a
minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light
illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the
face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” said the woman’s
voice.

The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out
of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a
highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with
gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like
some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were
paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them.
Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the lefthand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of
wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.

Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger
than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was
a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air.
Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a
house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and
wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands,
the point of the centaur’s arrow, the tip of the goblin’s hat, and each of the
house-elf’s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the
pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of
witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning
looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.

They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry
workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others
battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked.
As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts
glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign
beside it read:

All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St.
Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found
himself thinking desperately.
“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream
of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the
left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A badly shaven wizard in
peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily
Prophet.

“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod,
thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s front and
back.

“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden
instrument and holding out his hand.
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass
instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish.
It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit
in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That
correct?”
“Yes,” said Harry nervously.
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small
brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at Harry.
“Thank you.”

“Hang on . . .” said the wizard slowly.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest to his
forehead.
“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the
shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of
wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the
gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind
wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around
one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood
nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.

“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.
“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box.
“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We thought it was a bogstandard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach
of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.”
With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the
golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the
rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the
lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at
his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so.
The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains
rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in
the telephone box rang out again.

“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating
the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones
Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.”
The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with
various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of
the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks,
extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The
doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman’s voice said,
“Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo
Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and
Apparation Test Center.”

Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got
out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry
stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a
pale violet color and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the
edges of their wings.

“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him. “We used
to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable  .  .  . droppings all over the
desks . . .”
As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying
lamp in the lift’s ceiling.

“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation,
incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the
International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of
Wizards, British Seats.”
When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more
witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light
from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it.
“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison
Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.”
“’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left
the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet
again.

“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,
including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters,
and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.”
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a
witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was
trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the
lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the
voice said, “Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement,
including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and
Wizengamot Administration Services.”

“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of
the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the other side of
the floor.”
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which
sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”
“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows; Magical
Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day. We had two
months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just
round here, Harry.”

They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and
emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing
with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like
miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR
HEADQUARTERS.

Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The
Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of
wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their
favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarletrobed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with his boots up
on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with
a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley
Shacklebolt.

“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. “I’ve
been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?”
“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a hurry.”
They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other,
and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley
stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very
last cubicle.

Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at him
from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the
one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — papered the walls.
The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins
were glowing like jewels.

“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of
parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on flying
Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve received
information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.”
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, “Give
him the magazine, he might find it interesting.” Then he said in normal
tones, “And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report
held our investigation up for a month.”
“If you had read my report you would know that the term is ‘firearms,’”
said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for
information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He
dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before seven, Molly’s
making meatballs.”

He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle, through a
second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along
another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor,
and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar,
revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass
plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE ARTIFACTS.
Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom
cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely
room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets
lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall
space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were
several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two
illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children’s
books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster
that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves
that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood
beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of
it.

“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off
his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve asked, but
they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn’t look as if
Perkins is in yet.”
Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while Mr.
Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had
given him.

“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The
Quibbler from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it. “Yes, he’s right,
I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what’s this now?”
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest
on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud,
“‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly
investigate immediately.’ This is getting ridiculous . . .”
“A regurgitating toilet?”

“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had two last
week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling
the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine.
The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they’re
called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —”
“Plumbers?”

“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we can
catch whoever’s doing it.”
“Will it be Aurors who catch them?”
“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the ordinary Magical Law
Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”
A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just
entered the room, panting.
“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at Harry. “Thank
goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for
you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve obviously missed
it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —”
“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. Weasley.
“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve
changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o’clock now and it’s down
in old Courtroom Ten —”

“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —”
Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair.
“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!”
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left
the office at a run, Harry on his heels.
“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said breathlessly as they
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as
they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at
Perkins’s desk.
“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d missed it
it would have been catastrophic!”
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at
the down button.
“Come ON!”

The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped
Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button.
“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley
angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless — but
no . . .”
A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment,
and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.
“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid
open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain.
The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful
face got in.

“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to
descend. “Don’t often see you down here . . .”
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the
balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.”
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did
not make him feel any more comfortable.
“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at that.
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they
sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were
bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set
at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but
instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left,
where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time.
“The lift doesn’t even come down this far  .  .  . why they’re doing it
there . . .”

They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor,
which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s dungeon at
Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they
passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.”
Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an
immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his
chest.

“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. “Get in there.”
“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?”
“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!”
Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam’s apple. He
swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the
courtroom.


CHAPTER  EIGHT

THE HEARING

arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had
entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had
been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore’s
Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life
imprisonment in Azkaban.
The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches
rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were
many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the
heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
“You’re late.”

“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had changed.”
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. “An owl was sent to
you this morning. Take your seat.”
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of
which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and
bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked
across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the
chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick
he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.

There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plumcolored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of
the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere
expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat,
though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the
indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, squarejawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudge’s left; she wore a
monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s right was another witch, but
she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present — finally — let us
begin. Are you ready?” he called down the row.

“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was
sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting
some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s eyes, behind his
horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his
hand.

“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a ringing
voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, “into offenses committed
under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and
the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at
number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia
Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement;
Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court
Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —”
“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,”
said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked
his neck.

Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard
and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked
up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his
very crooked nose.
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on
Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly
witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in
welcome.

A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of
Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song
gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumbledore was not
looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered
Fudge.

“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumbledore.
Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and — er — place
of the hearing had been changed, then?”
“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, due to a
lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.”
“Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I — Weasley,
could you — ?”

“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his
wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of
nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long
fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite
interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only
when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.
“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, then. So. The
charges. Yes.”

He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep
breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as follows: That he
did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his
actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of
Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggleinhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at
twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under
paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage
Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International
Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy.
“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his
parchment.

“Yes,” Harry said.
“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal
magic three years ago, did you not?”
“Yes, but —”
“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?”
said Fudge.
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while
you are under the age of seventeen?”
“Yes, but —”
“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?”
“Yes, but —”
“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?”
“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —”
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a booming
voice.

“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.
“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more
than vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a
stag, it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus
before now?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”

“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus
at that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.

“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge in a
testy voice. “In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have
thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!”
Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was
the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.
“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, before anyone could
interrupt him again.

He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be
somehow denser than before.
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick
eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. “What do you
mean, boy?”
“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for
me and my cousin!”

“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the
Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. “Yes. Yes, I thought
we’d be hearing something like this.”
“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of great
surprise. “I don’t understand —”

“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let me explain. He’s
been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice
little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see dementors, can they,
boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s just your word and no
witnesses . . .”

“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering
from the court. “There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the
alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it
—”

“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face.
“I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very wellrehearsed story —”
Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that
alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.”
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air
out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with
the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, “We haven’t
got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this
dealt with quickly —”

“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that under
the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present
witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the Department of
Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?” he continued, addressing the
witch in the monocle.

“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.”
“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is this person?”
“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the door.
Should I — ?”
“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once,
hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and hastened past
Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked
scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change
out of her carpet slippers.
Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second
one for himself.

“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself
nervously on the very edge of her seat.
“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.
“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,”
said Mrs. Figg.

“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging
other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. “That situation has
always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.”
“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have me registered,
would you?”

“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be checking
that. You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley.
Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking left and right
along the bench where he sat.
“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.
Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. “Very well,” he said
coolly. “What is your story?”

“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of
Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,”
gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying
by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I
saw dementors running —”
“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run, they
glide.”

“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink
appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley toward what
looked like two boys.”
“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so
that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh.
“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —”
“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors  . . . describe
them.”

“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. “They
were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs.
Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever
seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth
of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches
over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise
they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a
large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a
frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and
nodded.

“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge
snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a
very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness
had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . .”
Her voice shook and died.

Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under
her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.
“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.
“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more
confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One of them had
fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was
Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he
produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with
his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin. And that . . .
that was what happened,” Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not
looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes
and said, rather aggressively, “That’s what you saw, is it?”
“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated.

“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.”
Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up
and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.
“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily.
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice. “She
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I
can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren’t —”
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to
come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge. “The odds on that must be very,
very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —”
“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by
coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly.

The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved
slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent.
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily.
“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.
“I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of
dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge.
“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the
Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have already
given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.”

“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe
that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors
remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.”
“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask ourselves
why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that
alleyway on the second of August.”

In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of
Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat
with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide,
slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the
little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in
mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to
the Minister,” said Fudge.

The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry
aback; he had been expecting a croak.
“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,” she
said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So silly of
me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that
the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!”

She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck
stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It
could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry
of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his
cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry
might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore politely. “Of course,
these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control —”
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped Fudge, who
had turned brick red.

Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why
two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked
without authorization.”
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not
do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle
Vernon would have been proud.

“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely expressing
my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.”
He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared
back at him, frowning slightly.

“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if
indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the subject of
this hearing!” said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry Potter’s offenses
under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!”
“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the presence of dementors in
that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that
magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as
those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of
the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the
time of the —”

“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled
Fudge.
“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are in
agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances
falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?”
“If there were dementors, which I doubt —”
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If you
still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she
would not object.”

“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before
him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a
witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said
Dumbledore.

“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. “Have
you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has
come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of
magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used
three years ago —”

“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.
“A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts
School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to give
evidence if you wish.”

“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that’s
not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge shouted,
banging his fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I
presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,”
said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school —”
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for
misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not relevant to this
inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of
coolness behind his words.

“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at school, eh? You
think so?”
“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students,
Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said
Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges
have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the
second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld,
you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws
yourself.”

“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And you
certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few
short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already
become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic!”

A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats.
Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his
right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.
“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is no law
yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for every bit of
magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense
and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your
verdict.”

Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge
glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore,
seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in
telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a
decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry’s attempt
to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire
Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.

Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an
unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the
hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a
good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have
explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over,
about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed. . . .
Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his
swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he
merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but
found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.
“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?” said Madam
Bones’s booming voice.

Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of
them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before
he could finish Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of conviction?”
Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on
his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in
the second row.

Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something
large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep
breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well,
very well . . . cleared of all charges.”
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out
his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I must be
getting along. Good day to you all.”
And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.


CHAPTER  NINE

THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY

umbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He
remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with
his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their
feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry
stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention
except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s right, who was now gazing down at
him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye,
or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge
seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy
with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when
nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.

He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and almost
collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale
and apprehensive.

“Dumbledore didn’t say —”
“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all
charges!”

Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.
“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found you
guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —”
But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened
again. The Wizengamot were filing out.

“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to
let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”
“I think so,” said Harry quietly.

One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a
few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley, but
most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were
almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley
and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost
appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like
Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past
clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back
rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley’s mouth
tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had noticed his
third son.

“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good
news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disappeared up
the stairs to the ninth level. “I’ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in
Bethnal Green. Come on . . .”

“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grinning.
Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to
sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.
“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they mounted
the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, it’s more the
attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some
wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much deeper and
nastier, and I for one —”

Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninthlevel corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from
them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale
face.
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too broke off
in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry’s
face.

“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something heavy.
He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood,
and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord
Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared
look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry
of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told
Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.

“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle
out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping . . .”
Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.

“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing
toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were up on the
second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle
artifacts home and bewitching them?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s
shoulder.

“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any
concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes;
Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket
of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s favorite boy, you must
not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us. . . . Shall we go up to
your office, then, Minister?”
“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. Weasley.
“This way, Lucius.”

They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not let
go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to
do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing down here?”
“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr.
Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore when
I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge again.”
“What private business have they got together anyway?”

“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the right
people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want passed . . .
Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy . . .”
The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped
around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the
doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like
Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put the
Imperius Curse on him?”

“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. Weasley. “But
Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment —
which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it
anymore just now, Harry . . .”
The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted
Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again.
They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry
remembered.

“Wait  .  .  .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his
pocket, he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid
smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and
centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at
humans of any description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping
servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione
would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his money bag
upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into
the pool at the statues’ feet.

“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with
stuff!”
“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was
now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case against you,
none at all . . .”

“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I’d
get off,” said Harry, smiling.
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and
Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He got off, he
got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was
smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”
“What?” said Sirius sharply.

“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine,
then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought to know.”
“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”
“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green
waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but Kingsley
might be dropping in for dinner —”
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley, as Mr.
Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have some lunch,
you hardly ate breakfast . . .”

Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier
than they had done since he had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld
Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented
by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house
seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked
less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the
source of all the noise.

“’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way
they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing great
mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound highly
ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked to me,
though. Or even looked at me.”
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he
clapped his hand to it.
“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing.  .  .  . It happens all the time
now . . .”

None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping
themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred,
George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious, but
before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet Dumbledore turns
up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”
“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a huge
plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very busy at the
moment.”

“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one
person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly
overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very
good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry’s hand
and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier and
surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending
increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry had
confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a
moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. “You belong at
Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he attempted to
prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger, “you
wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the Order of
the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming
to live here with him.”

“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione
wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of
him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both be outcasts
together.”
“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely
shrugged.

“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius
gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.
“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said Hermione
simply.

At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.
“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard.
“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron bitterly.
“D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?”
“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can do
your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”
“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.

“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps
you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs.
Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea
to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could
do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W.,
it would raise awareness as well as funds —”
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably, but only
so Harry could hear him.

Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the
end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to
play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology
greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where
half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults
out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any
of this within earshot of Sirius.

The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have
expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the
Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes
only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure
that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable
or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to
know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig’s
owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their
bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.

“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to
Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .”
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the
bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which
swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It contained two
pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term started on the first of
September, the other telling him which books he would need for the coming
year.

“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book of
Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by
Wilbert Slinkhard.”
Crack.

Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them
doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.
“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said Fred
conversationally.

“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher,” said George.
“And about time too,” said Fred.
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few
weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying,
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.”
“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last four?”
said George.

“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a
trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. “Yeah,
I see what you mean.”

“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred.
Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very still
with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look
over his shoulder at the parchment.
Fred’s mouth fell open too.
“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?”
George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into
George’s palm.

“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.
“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron’s
grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .”
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested Harry
had tricked them in some way.

“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George
indignantly.
“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred.
“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said George
to Fred.

“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble, mate.
Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.”
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a
scathing look.
“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .”
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the prefect
badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a
moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was superimposed
on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy’s chest
on his very first day at Hogwarts.

The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks
flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.
“Did you — did you get — ?”
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek.
“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too, Harry, me
too!”
“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand. “It’s
Ron, not me.”
“It — what?”

“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said.
“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I mean
—”
She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on
his face.
“It’s my name on the letter,” he said.
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well . . .
wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”
“Unexpected,” said George, nodding.
“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . . Ron’s
done loads of . . . he’s really . . .”

The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed into
the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing around at
all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting
the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll take them over to
Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you’re packing. Ron,
I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I
can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . . what color would you like?”
“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.
“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile.

“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly.
“His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.”
Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccupation
about pajamas.
“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not . . . ?”
Ron held up his badge.
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s.
“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect!
That’s everyone in the family!”

“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indignantly, as
his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.
“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful
news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step!
Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I’m just thrilled,
oh Ronnie —”

Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back
but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s neck, she was
kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his
badge.
“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip . . .” he muttered, trying to push her
away.
She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We gave
Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.”
“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not dare
believe his ears.

“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly. “How
about a nice new set of dress robes?”
“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as
though he sincerely regretted this generosity.
“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new rat, you
always liked Scabbers —”
“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.
“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new one for
a change . . .”

Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.
“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom to
buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t forget
to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither!”
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled
from the room.

Fred and George exchanged looks.
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a
falsely anxious voice.
“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George.
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them.
“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going to
put us in detention?”

“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which Fred
and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it, Hermione.”
“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pretending to
tremble, “with these two on our case . . .”
“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said George,
shaking his head.

And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.
“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through
which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the
room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron, they’re only jealous!”
“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects.  .  .  . Still,” he
added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go
with Mum and choose.  .  .  . She’ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but
there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . . Yeah, I think I’ll go and
tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows . . .”
He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at Hermione.
He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had
laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.

“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.
“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all,
and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.”
“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I
can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is
something they can understand —”
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did
not belong to him. “Take her!”

He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and
pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard
the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could
hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper
basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had
gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly
at the foot of the wardrobe.

He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year.
He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a
thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way toward certain
people. But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought about it . . . what
would he have expected?

Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to
himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have
expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as
Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he
really believe he was better than Ron?
No, said the small voice defiantly.

Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.
I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at anything
else.
That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in
lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he,
Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started at Hogwarts,
often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in
Harry’s head.

Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight
Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that
graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . .
And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the night
he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry thought
indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them!
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t choose
prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous
situations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have
something you don’t. . . .

Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s
clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .”
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with
himself.

Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was
not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world, going to sulk
because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron’s back,
ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something?
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He stood
up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as Ron
bounded back through the door.
“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Cleansweep if
she can.”

“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”
The smile faded off Ron’s face.
“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I thought it
would be you!”
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our trunks
packed, hadn’t we?”

It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to
retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them
back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his
prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it
into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as
though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George
dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent
Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in
his trunk.

Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden with
books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron
took from her with a moan of longing.
“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want
you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron
ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom,
an ecstatic expression on his face.
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the
heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE
— NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all
holiday.

“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told Harry,
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room. “Your
father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both owls and they’re
thrilled,” she added, beaming.
Fred rolled his eyes.
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and
Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a
butterbeer.

“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as
Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask you
for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room
and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just in case it’s
something really nasty.”
“No problem, Molly . . .”
Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through
the ceiling of the kitchen.
“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in the
corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go up and get
rid of it, Molly?”

“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have your
drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually . . .” She gestured at
the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said fondly, ruffling
Ron’s hair.

“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical
eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very
uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away toward Sirius
and Lupin.

“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal
eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore
thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn’t have appointed
you . . .”

Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the
trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs.
Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had
brought Mundungus with them too; he was wearing a long overcoat that
seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it
and put it with Moody’s traveling cloak.
“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a
drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor
prefects!”

Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then
applauded.
“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as
everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food. Her hair was
tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny’s older sister.
“My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.”
“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to
smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer
and choking on it.

“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh.
“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise
some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely say that I
failed dismally.”

Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either.
All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate,
feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would
listen.

“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the
Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a decent tailwind
according to Which Broomstick?”
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf
rights.

“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn’t it?
It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they’re
superior to other creatures . . .”
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s hair.
“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it would look
much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?”
“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who
were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and
beckoned Harry closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our financial
backer.”

“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to
Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint rattling
noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.
“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”
“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his saggy,
bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m not taking a
Knut under twenty.”

“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.
“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills,”
said George.
“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.
“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re okay.”
“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.
Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.
“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll take
’em quick.”

“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied
his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled off toward the
food. “We’d better get these upstairs . . .”
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to
him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George
were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they
finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had
seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family
row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that
Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for
Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in
the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own
name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even over the
surrounding chatter.

“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley.
“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”
persisted Kingsley, “’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him
every few days . . .”

Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he
had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table, though not
remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it
had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his
nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore
a strip off it with his teeth.

“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built
vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks.
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.
“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, I don’t
want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.”
She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he
could follow her without attracting attention.
“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.
“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.

Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring
sideways at Harry.
“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said.
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old
Wizarding photograph.
“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last night
when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore
hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought people might
like to see it.”

Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at
him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.
“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The Moody
in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly less gray and
his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle
on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks
after this was taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank and Alice
Longbottom —”

Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice
Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he
had never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened to
them  .  .  . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s
Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found
bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the picture, and the little
photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were partially
obscured could move to the front.

“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his
family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks
young  .  .  . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never
found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever . . .
Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid
hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother
Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, budge along . . .”
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and those
hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.
“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him,
strange bloke  .  .  . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her
personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you go,
thought that would interest you!”

Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him,
sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once
as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to
Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.
“Eh?” said Moody.

Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently
Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.
“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er  .  .  . listen, I’ve just
remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .”

He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed;
Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?” and Moody
had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door
and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to have
them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . . No one
would like that, he thought angrily. . . .

And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces  .  .  .
Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had
died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into
madness  .  .  . all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not
knowing that they were doomed.  .  .  . Well, Moody might find that
interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be
on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises.
Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
“Hello?” Harry said.

There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened the
drawing-room door.
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her
whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch
of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, no, it
couldn’t be —
But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs —
“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked.
“R-r-riddikulus!” Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand at
Ron’s body.

Crack.
Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide
open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.
“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again.
Crack.
Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of blood
running down his face.
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No  .  .  . riddikulus! Riddikulus!
RIDDIKULUS!”

Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .
“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down at his
own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —”
“What’s going on?”
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with
Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to
the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling
out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly, “Riddikulus!”
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where
it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff
of smoke.

“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a storm of
crying, her face in her hands.
“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .”
Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.
“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the head.
“Just a stupid boggart . . .”
“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .”
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pretending to
be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his
gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye had followed him all the
way out of the kitchen.
“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her
eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . . Being
silly . . .”

Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.
“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily. “Not
even able to get rid of a boggart . . .”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile.
“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again.
“Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come
through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if something dd-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? And what’s going to
happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going to look after Ron and
Ginny?”

“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last time. The
Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort’s
up to —”
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it — look, I
can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but
we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in the Order then,
you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the
Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one . . .”
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming faces. He
knew Moody was still watching him.

“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round. It’s a
matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the
whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I’m not sure
I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly.
“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur
died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let them
starve?”

Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes.
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later,
could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming
up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so
many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the
boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley’s family in
turn kept flashing before his eyes.

Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his
stomach churned horribly.
“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded again.
“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice from
the empty picture on the wall.

Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and it
seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried
about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.


CHAPTER  SEVENTEEN

A SLUGGISH MEMORY

ate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and
Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The
Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return
students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to
say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at
work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting.
Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on
and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day
with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George,
and Ginny all claimed credit).

“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley
sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. . . .”
“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a
very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a prat, it’s not really
a loss, is it?”

Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.
“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . .”
“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you know
me.”
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of you.
. . .”

Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!” He had one
last fleeting view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face
before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred
glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight
before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally
stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall’s office. She
barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.
“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.”
“No, Professor.”

Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came
spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out
of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out
of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over
grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In
the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who
was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.
“No,” she said.

“What d’you mean, ‘no’?”
“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”
“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?”
“Harry! Ginny!”

Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a
cloak, hat, and gloves.
“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and
Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly. “Did you have a good
Christmas?”

“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —”
“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at
Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “Oh, hang on — password.
Abstinence.”

“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to
reveal the portrait hole.
“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione, rolling her
eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. “She and her friend
Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks
down by the Charms corridor. Anyway . . .”

She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of
parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it.
“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson
with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. “I’ve got loads to
tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and
Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron’s
arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and
said, “There’s a table over here. . . . Coming, Ginny?”
“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry could not
help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and
Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led Hermione
over to the spare table.

“So how was your Christmas?”
“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at Won-Won’s?”
“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t you — ?”
“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.”
“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —”
“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine,
Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?”
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the
subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and
Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and
then said, “Don’t you think — ?”

“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into
telling him what he’s doing?”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione.
“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But this
definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny that.”
“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly.
“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!”
“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s name?”
Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure . . . Snape definitely
said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be?”

“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his father?”
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing
Lavender tickling Ron. “How’s Lupin?”
“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission among
the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “Have you heard of this
Fenrir Greyback?”

“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have you,
Harry!”
“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .”
“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!”
said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told
Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up
on Borgin’s progress!”

Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death Eater,
how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?”
“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless . . .”
“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round this
one!”

“Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.”
“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head. “We’ll see
who’s right.  .  . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the
Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . .”
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing
the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the
Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of
nerve asking him for help now.
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth
years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards
overnight.

APPARITION LESSONS
If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or
before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelve-week
course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition
instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost:
12 Galleons.

Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and
taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out
his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him,
slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry
turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish
to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up
with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and
his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with
Neville.

“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that
Harry was not to mention what had just happened. “Should be a laugh, eh?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t
enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.”
“I forgot you’d already done it. . . . I’d better pass my test first time,” said
Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and George did.”
“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?”
“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out from his
body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George didn’t go on about
it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .”
“When can we take the actual test?”
“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!”
“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle
. . .”

“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I
wanted.”
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All
that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of
store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.
“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his fingers to
indicate disappearance. “Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you
wait till I can do it back . . . He’ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .”
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too
enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that
was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that
ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.
“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after
Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set
Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum —
er — someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know.”

“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a
little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry
was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the
sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when
he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed
questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that
he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his
lesson with Dumbledore.

The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of previous
headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was
ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands lay on either side of it,
the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have
healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had
caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that
he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he
wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and
Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.

“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.”
“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me either. We
must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.”
Harry grinned.
“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s
doing a wonderful job.”
Dumbledore smiled.

“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office,
when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting
with you, hoping that you would give him your support —”
“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After
Umbridge?”

“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when
he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he
demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —”
“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the Daily
Prophet.”

“The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said
Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it
appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”
“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and through.’”
“How very rude of him.”
“I told him I was.”

Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind
Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s
intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore’s bright blue
eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When
Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, Harry.”

“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at
Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding
cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. “He has even attempted
to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t
kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with
the greatest regret.”

“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for more
information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over
the top of his half-moon spectacles.
“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either.
Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ?”
“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and Snape.”
“Professor Snape, Harry.”

“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . . well, I
followed them, actually. . . .”
Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face. When
Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank
you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind.
I do not think that it is of great importance.”
“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did
you understand — ?”

“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood
everything you told me,” said Dumbledore, a little sharply. “I think you
might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did.
Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that
you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.”
Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going
on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out
what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything
Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he
had heard, but pretending not to be?

“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, “you
definitely still trust — ?”
“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,” said
Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. “My answer has
not changed.”
“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently
only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important
things to discuss with you this evening.”

Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit
the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy?
As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.
“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends!
Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than
anything the other might have to contribute!”
“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said Harry
stiffly.

“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore briskly. “I
have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with
enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I
have collected.”
Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his
confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by
arguing further.

“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to
continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the
threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was
to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to
Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery
when he arrived at school.

“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a
quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to
be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the
Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his
blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat,
ancient and unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder
of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very
evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense
of self-importance.

“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with
displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the
staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an
unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew
attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his
arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were
most favorably impressed by him.”
“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the
orphanage?” asked Harry.

“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible
that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn
over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his
mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore’s tendency to trust people in
spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry
remembered something. . . .
“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle
who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as
much as the other teachers did.’”

“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,” said
Dumbledore. “I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close
eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from
my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure,
that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too
much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take
back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had
confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he
charmed so many of my colleagues.

“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated
friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have
already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them.
This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a
motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious
seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader
who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they
were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became
the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.

“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open
wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a
number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked,
the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of
Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was
wrongly accused of that crime.

“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,”
said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. “Few who
knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I
know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort,
after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching
old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.

“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed
with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an
orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems
that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields
in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in
the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his
father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he
dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and
began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the
woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if
she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.

“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of
his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and
set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small
crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming
mass into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced
it. Shall we?”

Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of
falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in
almost total darkness.

It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time
Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts’ house was now more
indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was
thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay
upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a
single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so
overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an
armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was
dead. But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked
awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned
lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and
handsome — the teenage Voldemort.

Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man
in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man
staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling
across the floor.

“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!”
And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.
“Stop.”
Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending
moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long
silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it.
“You speak it?”

“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing
the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful
admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. His face merely
expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
“Where is Marvolo?” he asked.
“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”
Riddle frowned.
“Who are you, then?”
“I’m Morfin, ain’t I?”
“Marvolo’s son?”

“’Course I am, then . . .”
Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and
Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand.
“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. “You look mighty
like that Muggle.”

“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.
“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in
the big house over the way,” said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon
the floor between them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But he’s older
now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it. . . .”

Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge
of the table for support. “He come back, see,” he added stupidly.
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities.
Now he moved a little closer and said, “Riddle came back?”
“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!” said Morfin, spitting
on the floor again. “Robbed us, mind, before she ran off! Where’s the locket,
eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?”
Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working hi
mself into a rage again;
he brandished his knife and shouted, “Dishonored us, she did, that little
slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It’s
over, innit. . . . It’s over. . . .”

He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As
he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and
Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything. . . .

Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and they were
soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore’s
office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what happened?”
“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,”
said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. “When he awoke next
morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone.
“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along
the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing
room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father.

“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do
not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse
does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before
me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the
other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew
that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle
house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking
one of the murdered people.

“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him,
to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot,
giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have
killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed
over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the
Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.
All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared.
‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over again. ‘He’ll
kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said again.
He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of
Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other
poor souls who have expired within its walls.”

“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up
straight.

“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to show us this,
but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his
uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over
the way.’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch
mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating
the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father
who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s
mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the
ancient ring he wore, and departed.”

“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”

“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of
him,” said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into
Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was
able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I
was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I
extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I
attempted to use it to secure Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the
Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had done all
that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn’t
he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”

“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator:
You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover
Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”
“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re
underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the
Ministry won’t know?”
“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said
Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry’s
face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s
obedience while within their walls.”

“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened here, look
what happened to Morfin!”
“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve
to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting
late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. . . .”
Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry
fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most
important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved
difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly;
did memories go bad?

“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied
the phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the
Pensieve, then . . .”
And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in
front of a man he recognized at once.

It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald
that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair
quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched,
though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown.
His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He
was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden
buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of
strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in
a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine,
the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.

Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that
they were standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting
around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their midteens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome
face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay
negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was
wearing Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father.
“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked.
“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging a
reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly
by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your information,
boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.”

Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t, and your
careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by
the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole
room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see
nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then
Slughorn’s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, “You’ll go
wrong, boy, mark my words.”

The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any
allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just
happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock
standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven o’clock.
“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d better get
going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by
tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass
over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind.
Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room
with Slughorn.

“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still
present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a
prefect . . .”
“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that
Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore,
smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice boomed out again, just
as it had done before.

“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I did!
Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning them
again!”

“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. “Time to go.”
And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the rug in
front of Dumbledore’s desk.

“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but
he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and
the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that
nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a
question and failed to get an answer.
“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind
his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.”
“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled with his
own recollections.”

“But why would he do that?”
“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said
Dumbledore. “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a
better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is,
as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it
shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.
“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be
your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which
will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.”
Harry stared at him.

“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible,
“you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or Veritaserum. . . .”
“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting
both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished at Occlumency
than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an
antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me
this travesty of a recollection.

“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from
Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do
not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the
rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to
penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory,
Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real
thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.”
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly.
“Good night, sir.”

As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas
Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than
you, Dumbledore.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes
gave another low, musical cry.


CHAPTER  EIGHTEEN

BIRTHDAY SURPRISES

he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that
Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still
refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give him a
contemptuous look.

Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at
all.
“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried
egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just
hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.”

Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must be determined to
hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it out of him,” she
said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break.
“Horcruxes . . . Horcruxes  . . . I’ve never even heard of them. . . .”

“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione
might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.
“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would Voldemort
have wanted to know about them? I think it’s going to be difficult to get the
information, Harry, you’ll have to be very careful about how you approach
Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . .”

“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . .”
“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” she said, flaring up
at once. “After all, when has Won-Won’s judgment ever been faulty?”
“Hermione, can’t you — ?”

“No!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and
ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry,
Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her
cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both
Harry and Ron.

“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione’s
haughty profile.
But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the
front of the room.

“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get
through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell me — ? But
Miss Granger can, of course!”
Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law-states-that-theantidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-theantidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.”
“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we
accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . .”

Harry was going to have to take Slughorn’s word for it that Golpalott’s
Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart
from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either.
“.  .  . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct
identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our
primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those
ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will,
by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements —”

Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently
on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he
could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed
to grasp what was going on.

“. . . and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come and take
one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the
poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t forget
your protective gloves!”

Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn’s desk
before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move, and by the time
Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the
contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.
“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much with this,
Harry,” she said brightly as she straightened up. “You have to understand
the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!”

Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn’s desk,
which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire
underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do
next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather
gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.

“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron muttered to Harry.
Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned
to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott’s Third Law, stated word
for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the
Prince’s hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like
Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.
“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.

Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron.
Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was
now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the
words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis
Revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron
hastened to imitate him.

It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best
potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had
peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon,
preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn
his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him.
Hermione’s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed
being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the
mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal
phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry
bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and turned a few pages with
unnecessary force.

And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes:
Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he once, long ago,
heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape mentioned them in their first-ever Potions
lesson? “A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from
most poisons.”

It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been
their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for
desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged
within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he
found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled
the word BEZOARS.

He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two minutes left, everyone!”
Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like driedup kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the
cupboard, and hurried back to his cauldron.
“Time’s . . . UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s see how you’ve
done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?”
Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various
antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to
cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her.
Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in
the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the
bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.
Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s potion and passed on
to Ron’s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron’s cauldron, but backed
away swiftly, retching slightly.

“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to show me?”
Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a
moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his
head and roared with laughter.
“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up
so that the class could see it. “Oh, you’re like your mother. . . . Well, I can’t
fault you.  .  .  . A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these
potions!”

Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid.
Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a
chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes
for nobody but Harry.

“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?” she asked
through gritted teeth.
“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said Slughorn
happily, before Harry could reply. “Just like his mother, she had the same
intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . .
Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the
trick . . . although as they don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s
still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . .”

The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy,
who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like catsick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry
had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.
“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten points to Gryffindor
for sheer cheek!”

Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.
Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his
bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked
rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the
room.

“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said Slughorn
affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin briefcase.
“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I wanted
to ask you something.”

“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked
his lips and said hoarsely, “What did you say?”
“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see —”
“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn. His voice had
changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He
fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his
sweating brow. “Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well?
Hasn’t he?”

“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face.
“Of course . . . well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I
don’t know anything — anything” — he repeated the word forcefully —
“about Horcruxes.”
He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into
his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door.
“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit more to
the memory —”
“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you?
WRONG!”

He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word,
slammed the dungeon door behind him.
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them
of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry
had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that
Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said Harry irritably.
“Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort,
didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip!” he added in exasperation, as Ron winced
at the sound of the name.

Infuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s attitudes, Harry
brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He
decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had
forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false
sense of security before returning to the attack.
When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted
to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the
matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little
evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule
Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived.
Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an
invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not
help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful
as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities
to question him.

Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time
in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was
annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.
“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!” she told
him. “Not a single one! I’ve been right through the restricted section and
even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most
gruesome potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction
to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical
inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention
it then?” she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a
ghostly wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.

The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced
by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and
a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The
upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first Apparition lesson, which was
scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be
missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.
When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with
Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against
the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as
they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and
Sprout — the Heads of Houses — and a small wizard whom Harry took to
be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with
transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a
single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether
constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his
substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to
vanish.

“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had
arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet. “My name is Wilkie
Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next
twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in
this time —”

“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.
Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked
furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have
been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who
also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less
because of Malfoy’s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had
reprimanded one of his House.

“— by which time, many of you may be ready to take your tests,”
Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.
“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate
within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within
the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I
emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this
Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.

“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a
clear five feet of space in front of you.”
There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged
into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of Houses
moved among the students, marshaling them into position and breaking up
arguments.

“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione.
But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd,
past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to
position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past
Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by
dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at
the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of
the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five
feet away and looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy shot at him, oblivious
to Harry standing right behind him. “It’s taking longer than I thought it
would.”

Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he
was going to say. “Look, it’s none of your business what I’m doing, Crabbe,
you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a lookout!”
“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for
me,” Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.
Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at that
precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, “Quiet!” and silence fell
again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again.
“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then . . .”
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on
the floor in front of every student.

“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!”
said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Deliberation!
“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,” said
Twycross. “In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon
that destination now.”

Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was
staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the
circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of
nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn’t stop puzzling over
what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.
“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination to occupy the
visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to
every particle of your body!”

Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie
Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned
pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry
bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.
“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give the command . . .
Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with
deliberation! On my command, now . . . one —”
Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively
alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.
“— two —”

Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten
what the three D’s stood for.
“— THREE!”
Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He was not the
only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville
was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind
of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he
caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.
“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to
have expected anything better. “Adjust your hoops, please, and back to your
original positions. . . .”

The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad.
Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible
screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones
of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet
away where she had started.
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff
of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her
leg but looking horrified.
“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” said Wilkie
Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when the mind is insufficiently
determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your destination, and
move, without haste, but with deliberation  . . . thus.”
Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms
outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the
Hall.

“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again  .  .  . one — two —
three —”
But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing
that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak
at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not
forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.”
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of
the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as
people began moving toward the entrance hall.
“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. “I think I felt
something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet.”
“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said a voice behind
them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.
“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this interruption. “But I
don’t care about that now —”

“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to learn to
Apparate?” said Ron incredulously.
“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, glancing over his
shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the
entrance hall. “Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do.
. . .”

Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at a run.
They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the
fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to
their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of
their trusted shortcuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the
portrait hole.
“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron, panting
slightly.

“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way
through the door to the boys’ staircase.
Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk
and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
“Harry . . .”
“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with
Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.”
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he
now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway.”
At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s surface. Here
was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around
it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants.
“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently.
He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.
“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin common
room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .”
Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly. “And
the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping
watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out
what he’s —”

He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong
smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair
of pants.
Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all
over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as
he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between
lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious.
Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their
own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted
corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but
impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry
toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school
grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high
level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose
that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon
the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be
going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things
happened as people got older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly,
were living proof.

February moved toward March with no change in the weather except that
it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on
all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been
canceled. Ron was furious.
“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking forward to that!”
“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not after what happened
to Katie.”

She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What was more, further
disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several
relatives of students at Hogwarts.
“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!” said Ron
grumpily. “Big birthday treat . . .”
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a
few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was
running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward Wilkie
Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for
him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead.
“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on the first of
March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.”
He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it joined a small pile
of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in
the night.

“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, Harry got
out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the
Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the
contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks
in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.
“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly
and murmuring, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” so that
Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of
Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him.
“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin
dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t think he’s in his bed. . . .”
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now
and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.

“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a heavy gold
watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of
hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I’ll come of age
next year too. . . .”

“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more
closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the
Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . . He was nowhere near
Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He wasn’t in any of the bathrooms
or in the hospital wing. . . .

“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.
“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone again!”
“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth
as he slid out of bed to get dressed. “Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll
have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose
.  .  .” Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then
shrugged and helped himself to a third.

Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,”
though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an
explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not
think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but
even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: Harry had
lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow
Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon.
“Ready?” he said to Ron.

He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not
moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed
window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.
“Ron? Breakfast.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Harry stared at him.
“I thought you just said — ?”
“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I don’t want
to eat.”

Harry scrutinized him suspiciously.
“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t you?”
“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You . . . you wouldn’t understand.”
“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.
“Harry!” said Ron suddenly.
“What?”

“Harry, I can’t stand it!”
“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely
alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.
“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely.
Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted
to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “LavLav,” he would have to put his foot down.
“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying to inject
a note of common sense into the proceedings.
“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate gesture.
“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, bewildered. “She keeps
snogging you, doesn’t she?”

Ron blinked. “Who are you talking about?”
“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an increasing sense that
all reason had dropped out of the conversation.
“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to
illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight.
They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said,
“This is a joke, right? You’re joking.”
“I think . . . Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled voice.
“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed
eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay  .  .  . Say that again with a straight
face.”

“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you seen her hair, it’s all
black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her —”
“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry impatiently, “but joke’s
over, all right? Drop it.”
He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing
blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked around. Ron’s fist was
drawn right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike
again.

Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the
incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus!
Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled
helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him.
“What was that for?” Harry bellowed.
“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” shouted Ron, who was
slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.
“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into — ?”
And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, and the truth hit him
with the force of a stampeding troll.

“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?”
“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair
as he struggled to get free. “I offered you one, didn’t I?”
“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?”
“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!”
“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand? They
were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the
map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas,
and they’re all spiked with love potion!”

But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry — do you know
her? Can you introduce me?”

Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously
hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him — the part
closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea of letting
Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore
off. . . . But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had
not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would
deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for
Romilda Vane.

“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. “I’m going to let you
down now, okay?”
He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but
Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, leading the way
to the door.

“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.
“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said Harry, inventing
wildly.
“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said Ron eagerly.
“Great idea,” said Harry.
Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had
not foreseen.
“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a birthday —”
“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently. “Harry’s going to introduce me
to Romilda Vane.”

And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the portrait
hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have
turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as
the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.
Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but
he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet
dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call. . . . I generally sleep
late on a Saturday. . . .”

“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry as quietly as
possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his
room, “but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You
couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d take him to Madam Pomfrey,
but we’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes
and, you know . . . awkward questions . . .”
“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an
expert potioneer like you?” asked Slughorn.
“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now
elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, “well,
I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it
right, Ron might’ve done something serious —”
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her, Harry — is
he hiding her?”

“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with
professional interest. “They can strengthen, you know, the longer they’re
kept.”
“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now positively wrestling with
Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. “It’s his birthday,
Professor,” he added imploringly.

“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, relenting. “I’ve got
the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult antidote. . . .”
Ron burst through the door into Slughorn’s overheated, crowded study,
tripped over a tasseled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry
around the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that, did she?”
“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion
kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.
“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?”
“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear
liquid. “Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when
she arrives, you know.”

“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.
Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them.
Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an
expression of utmost horror.
“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled.
“Thanks a lot, Professor.”

“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said Slughorn, as Ron
collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. “Pick-me-up, that’s
what he needs,” Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded
with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got wine, I’ve got one last bottle of
this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for
Christmas . . . ah, well . . .” He shrugged. “He can’t miss what he’s never
had! Why don’t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday?

Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .”
He chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the first time he had
found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt
to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep
Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got through enough of the oakmatured mead . . .
“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of
mead each before raising his own. “Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph —”
“Ron —” whispered Harry.

But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already
thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.
There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry
knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.
“— and may you have many more —”

“Ron!”
Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then
crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from
his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!”
But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: His
skin was turning blue.

“What — but —” spluttered Slughorn.
Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn’s open potion
kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron’s gargling
breath filled the room. Then he found it — the shriveled kidneylike stone
Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.

He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his jaw, and thrust the
bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his
body became limp and still.


CHAPTER  NINETEEN

ELF TAILS

o, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained,
the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and
Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the
double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out.
Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and George
had arrived at ten past.

“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said George
grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside cabinet and
sitting beside Ginny.

“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,” said Fred.
“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him —” said George.
“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up.
“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily. “A
Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot
aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore.  .  .  . But never
mind that now.”

He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
“How exactly did it happen, Harry?”
Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred
times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione,
and to Ginny.

“. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up
a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up,
and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he’ll be all right. Madam
Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week or so . . . keep taking essence
of rue . . .”

“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said George in a low
voice.
“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turning cold at
the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay
hands on the little stone.

Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally
quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital
wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no
part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been
poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightenedlooking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.
“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny.

“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago — they’re in
Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be back soon. . . .”
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his
sleep.

“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for
the opportunity to start discussing it again. “Slughorn poured it out —”
“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass without you
seeing?”

“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?”
“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he could have mixed up
the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?”
“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked Ginny.
“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of people who’d like to
poison Harry, mustn’t there? ‘The Chosen One’ and all that?”
“So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny.
“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly.
“He could be under the Imperius Curse,” said George.
“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison could have been in
the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.”
“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”

“Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,” said
Harry. “Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And
.  . .” He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to
extract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way,
maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.”
“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to
Dumbledore for Christmas,” Ginny reminded him. “So the poisoner could
just as easily have been after Dumbledore.”

“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said Hermione,
speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad
head cold. “Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a
good chance he’d keep something that tasty for himself.”
“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them.
They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering
incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came
striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping
behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized
footprints all over the floor.

“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, I bin readin’ to
him — didn’ get up ter dinner till jus’ now an’ then Professor Sprout told
me abou’ Ron! How is he?”
“Not bad,” said Harry. “They say he’ll be okay.”
“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out
of her office.
“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out.
“Oh  .  .  . yes .  .  .” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been
counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her
confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand.
“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head
as he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ don’ believe it  .  .  . Look at him lyin’
there. . . . Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?”

“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.”
“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team,
could they?” said Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . .”
“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George.
“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,”
said Fred fairly.

“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection
between the attacks,” said Hermione quietly.
“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.
“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t,
although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the
necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed.
Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this even
more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many
people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.”

Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, the
dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the
ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make
a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold
of Harry and hugged him very tightly. “Dumbledore’s told us how you
saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed. “Oh, Harry, what can we say? You
saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur . . . now you’ve saved Ron . . .”
“Don’t be . . . I didn’t . . .” muttered Harry awkwardly.

“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think
about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that
it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your
compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.”
Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when
Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six
visitors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to leave and
Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.
“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked
back along the corridor to the marble staircase. “All this new security, an’
kids are still gettin’ hurt. . . . Dumbledore’s worried sick. . . . He don’ say
much, but I can tell. . . .”

“Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?” asked Hermione desperately.
“I ’spect he’s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,” said Hagrid. “But he
doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or
they’d’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they? Wha’ worries me,” said Hagrid,
lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure,
checked the ceiling for Peeves), “is how long Hogwarts can stay open if
kids are bein’ attacked. Chamber o’ Secrets all over again, isn’ it? There’ll
be panic, more parents takin’ their kids outta school, an’ nex’ thing yeh
know the board o’ governors . . .”

Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted
serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, “.  .  . the board o’
governors’ll be talkin’ about shuttin’ us up fer good.”
“Surely not?” said Hermione, looking worried.
“Gotta see it from their point o’ view,” said Hagrid heavily. “I mean, it’s
always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect
accidents, don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up
tergether, but attempted murder, tha’s diff’rent. ’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s
angry with Sn —”

Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was
visible of his face above his tangled black beard.
“What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with Snape?”
“I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have
been a bigger giveaway. “Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I
need ter —”

“Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” Harry asked loudly.
“Shhhh!” said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. “Don’ shout stuff
like that, Harry, d’yeh wan’ me ter lose me job? Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d
care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag —”
“Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” said Harry forcefully.
“What’s Snape done?”

“I dunno, Harry, I shouldn’ta heard it at all! I — well, I was comin’ outta
the forest the other evenin’ an’ I overheard ’em talking — well, arguin’.
Didn’t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried not ter
listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it
out.”

“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.
“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took too much fer
granted an’ maybe he — Snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it anymore —”
“Do what?”

“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a bit overworked, tha’s
all — anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he’d agreed ter do it an’ that
was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An’ then he said summat abou’
Snape makin’ investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’
strange abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione
exchanged looks full of meaning. “All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter
look inter that necklace business —”
“Yeah, but Dumbledore’s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?”
said Harry.

“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there
was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. “I know what yeh’re
like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this
than there is.”

“Look out,” said Hermione tersely.
They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over
the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner,
hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.

“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean detention!”
“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with me, aren’ they?”
“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch obnoxiously.
“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Hagrid, firing up
at once.

There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris
had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch’s
skinny ankles.
“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.
Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off;
Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They
passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking
happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,
When there’s strife and when there’s trouble
Call on Peevsie, he’ll make double!

The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung
forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and
empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet;
Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day.
Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry,
however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down
into the dying embers.

So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry,
in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his
temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to
investigate the Slytherins . . . or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin:
Malfoy?

Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to
take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in
Harry’s suspicions? That seemed likely. It might even be that Dumbledore
did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from
procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it
right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. . . .
“There you are, Potter!”

Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been
quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all
prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer
look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.
“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disregarding
Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking
Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”

It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking
about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt
of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah . . . he might
not make it.”
“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had
certainly performed second-best in the trials.
“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So when’s practice?”
“What? Oh . . . there’s one tomorrow evening.”
“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got some
ideas on strategy you might find useful.”

“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear them tomorrow,
then. I’m pretty tired now . . . see you . . .”
The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did
not cause the sensation that Katie’s attack had done. People seemed to think
that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions
master’s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote
immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were
generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against
Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played
Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary
during the opening match against Slytherin.

Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was
rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the
Marauder’s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to
wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing
anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times
when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .

But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with
Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged
wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept
up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper
for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play
regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was
also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed
training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him
who was Captain.

Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which
Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggen’s Quidditch lectures. At
first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her
that Ron was in the hospital wing — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but
unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory
and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron’s feelings, a
most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.
“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked, after a
particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from
precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not
Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be
“serious.”

“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said
Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every
time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news
of Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as
possible.
“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.
“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry
uncomfortably.

“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender scornfully. “She didn’t
talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she
wants to make up with him now he’s all interesting.  . . . ”
“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked Harry.
“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about
Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door
pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take
him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could
follow him.

On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry
dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was
very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the
match, feeling it would overexcite him.
“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry nervously, apparently
forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.
“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be world-class and I
wouldn’t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he
thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can’t wait to
be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,” Harry added,
getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to
be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She’s driving me mad as well.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.”

“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said Harry.
“Yeah  .  .  . well  .  .  . it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He paused.
“Hermione going to look in before the match?” he added casually.
“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, good luck. Hope you
hammer McLag — I mean, Smith.”

“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you after the match.”
He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was
outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He
was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind
they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw
Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom
looked sulky and resentful.

Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless
laugh and continued walking.
“Where’re you going?” Harry demanded.
“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your business, Potter,”
sneered Malfoy. “You’d better hurry up, they’ll be waiting for ‘the Chosen
Captain’ — ‘the Boy Who Scored’ — whatever they call you these days.”
One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She
blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a
trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.

Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was
infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet
there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent:
Harry’s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent
seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at
the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .
“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the
changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and
Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their
legs.

“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over
his head.
“So?”
“So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of
girlfriends while everyone else is down here. . . .”
“Does it matter right now?”
“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, seizing his Firebolt
and pushing his glasses straight. “Come on then!”
And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening
cheers and boos.

There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there
were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.

“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the team. “Coote,
Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don’t see you coming —”
“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,” said
Harry angrily. “Just get up by the goalposts!”
Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.
“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudgingly.
He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam
Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his
team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it
good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle,
seize the Marauder’s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .
“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy voice,
echoing over the grounds. “He did the commentary last time, of course, and
Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it.
Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now
he’s playing them — oh, look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him,
I do like her, she’s very nice. . . .”

Harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. Surely nobody in their
right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from
above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace
of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking
slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts
about this appointment.

“. . . but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t
remember his name, it’s something like Bibble — no, Buggins —”
“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna.
The crowd laughed.

Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments
later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny
for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had
not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.
“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing
and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face
his Keeper.

“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen shouted back, red-faced
and furious.
“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,” said
Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd
cheered and jeered. “I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but
maybe it’s a clever ruse. . . .”

Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again,
scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.
Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad
supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored
again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she
appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and
kept attempting to draw the crowd’s attention to such things as interestingly
shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far
failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was
suffering from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.”
“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor McGonagall into Luna’s
megaphone.

“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper’s
got hold of one of the Beater’s bats.”
Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best
known to himself, had pulled Peakes’s bat from him and appeared to be
demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.
“Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts!” roared
Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe
at the Bludger and mishit it.

A blinding, sickening pain . . . a flash of light . . . distant screams . . . and
the sensation of falling down a long tunnel . . .
And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and
comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of
golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There
on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.
“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning.
Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital
wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must
have finished hours ago . . . as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry’s
head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of
bandages.

“What happened?”
“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back
against his pillows. “Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I’m
keeping you in overnight. You shouldn’t overexert yourself for a few
hours.”
“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry angrily, sitting up and
throwing back his covers. “I want to find McLaggen and kill him.”
“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion,’” said
Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her
wand in a threatening manner. “You will stay here until I discharge you,
Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.”
She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows,
fuming.

“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through clenched
teeth.
“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score was three
hundred and twenty to sixty.”
“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! When I get hold of
McLaggen —”

“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said Ron
reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hexing him with
that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve
dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not happy. . . .”
There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s voice; Harry could
tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly.
Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently
mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath
all the bandaging.

“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his voice now
shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . .
Loser’s Lurgy . . .”
But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and
after a while Ron’s snorts subsided.

“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a
long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly
constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form,
confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his
blessing. . . . “She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How
come? You left here early enough.”

“Oh . . .” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded. “Yeah . . .
well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like
they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made sure he
isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the
last match too, remember?” Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him now, the
match was such a fiasco. . . .”

“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply. “You couldn’t have missed a
Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you’re the Captain!”
“I want to know what he’s up to,” said Harry. “And don’t tell me it’s all
in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape —”
“I never said it was all in your head,” said Ron, hoisting himself up on an
elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, “but there’s no rule saying only one
person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re getting a bit
obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to
follow him . . .”

“I want to catch him at it!” said Harry in frustration. “I mean, where’s he
going when he disappears off the map?”
“I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning.
“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the
map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?”
“Well then, I dunno,” said Ron.

Silence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight
above him, thinking. . . .
If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been able to set
a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of
Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something
up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be
missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .
There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. After a while Madam
Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It
was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all
the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed,
and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew
that she was off to bed.

This was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been
brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had
fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and
the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the
incurably inept Professor Lockhart.  .  .  . That had been his most painful
injury by far . . . he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones
in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor
in the middle of the —”

Harry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He
had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how
could he have forgotten, why hadn’t he thought of it before?
But the question was, how to call him? What did you do?
Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.

“Kreacher?”
There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks
filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.
“What’s going — ?”

Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office
and muttered, “Muffliato!” so that she would not come running. Then he
scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on.
Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the
dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats,
the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there
was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above
the wrestling elves.

“I was watching that, Potty!” he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the
fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. “Look at the ickle creatures
squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy —”
“Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won’t, or
Dobby will shut Kreacher’s mouth for him!” cried Dobby in a high-pitched
voice.

“— kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of chalk at
the elves to enrage them further. “Tweaky, pokey!”
“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a
master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s
mistress say — ?”

Exactly what Kreacher’s mistress would have said they did not find out,
for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher’s mouth
and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their
beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and
kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the
lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his
earsies —”

Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlock!” Peeves clutched
at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures
but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to
the roof of his mouth.

“Nice one,” said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his
flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. “That was another
Prince hex, wasn’t it?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, twisting Kreacher’s wizened arm into a half nelson.
“Right — I’m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re
forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you
orders —”

“Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby
will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!” said Dobby, tears now
streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.
“Okay then,” said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who
fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.
“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he
gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.
“Yeah, I did,” said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey’s office door
to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that
she had heard any of the commotion. “I’ve got a job for you.”
“Kreacher will do whatever Master wants,” said Kreacher, sinking so low
that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, “because Kreacher has no
choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes —”
“Dobby will do it, Harry Potter!” squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized
eyes still swimming in tears. “Dobby would be honored to help Harry
Potter!”

“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,” said Harry.
“Okay then . . . I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.”
Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s face,
Harry went on, “I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and
what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.”
“Yes, Harry Potter!” said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with
excitement. “And if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the
topmost tower, Harry Potter!”

“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily.
“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?” croaked
Kreacher. “Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of
my old mistress?”

“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining
to prevent it immediately. “And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher,
or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him
messages or . . . or to contact him in any way. Got it?”

He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the
instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and
to Harry’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with
bitter resentment, “Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey
him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy
boy, oh yes. . . .”

“That’s settled, then,” said Harry. “I’ll want regular reports, but make
sure I’m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione
are okay. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like
a couple of wart plasters.”


CHAPTER  TWENTY

LORD VOLDEMORT’S REQUEST

arry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning,
restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and
now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned,
the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione
even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that
Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry’s chest
suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.

“What did they row about?” he asked, trying to sound casual as they
turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small
girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked
terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy
brass scales she was carrying.
“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. “Here
. . .”

She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, “Reparo.” The girl
did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and
watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.
“I swear they’re getting smaller,” he said.
“Never mind her,” said Harry, a little impatiently. “What did Ginny and
Dean row about, Hermione?”
“Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,”
said Hermione.

“It must’ve looked funny,” said Ron reasonably.
“It didn’t look funny at all!” said Hermione hotly. “It looked terrible and
if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught Harry he could have been very badly
hurt!”
“Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,”
said Harry, still trying to sound casual. “Or are they still together?”
“Yes, they are — but why are you so interested?” asked Hermione,
giving Harry a sharp look.
“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily,
but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when
a voice behind them called, “Harry!” giving him an excuse to turn his back
on her.

“Oh, hi, Luna.”
“I went to the hospital wing to find you,” said Luna, rummaging in her
bag. “But they said you’d left. . . .”
She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool,
and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands,
finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to
Harry.

“. . . I’ve been told to give you this.”
It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as
another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.
“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.
“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the
green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.
“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. “Everyone says I was
dreadful.”

“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t remember enjoying
commentary more! What is this, by the way?” he added, holding the
onionlike object up to eye level.
“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool
back into her bag. “You can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them.
They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.”
And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the
Gurdyroot.

“You know, she’s grown on me, Luna,” he said, as they set off again for
the Great Hall. “I know she’s insane, but it’s in a good —”
He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the
foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.
“Hi,” said Ron nervously.

“C’mon,” Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not
before they had heard Lavender say, “Why didn’t you tell me you were
getting out today? And why was she with you?”

Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half
an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them
exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as
though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an
inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a
particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even
consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry’s Herbology
essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point,
because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.
“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back
as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o’clock. “Listen,
I’ve got to hurry or I’ll be late for Dumbledore. . . .”

She did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences
in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole
and off to the headmaster’s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention
of toffee éclairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time,
knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.
“Enter,” called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door,
it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.
“Aha!” she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him
through her magnifying spectacles. “So this is the reason I am to be thrown
unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!”

“My dear Sybill,” said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice,
“there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but
Harry does have an appointment, and I really don’t think there is any more
to be said —”

“Very well,” said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. “If
you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a
school where my talents are better appreciated. . . .”
She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they
heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped
over one of her trailing shawls.
“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said Dumbledore, sounding
rather tired.

Harry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore’s
desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny
crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is teaching, then?” Harry
asked.

“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to be much more
trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself.
I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor
can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of
the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know — and I
think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy
about you and Voldemort, you see.”

Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But never mind my staffing
problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly — have
you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?”
“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and
Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his
determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost
forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from
Professor Slughorn. “Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of
Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.”
There was a little silence.

“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his
half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was
being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts
in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable
ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest
to retrieve the memory?”

“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to
get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well . . .
the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor
Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough
mood —”

“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”
“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the
memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in
danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full
recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set
you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is.
Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial
memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.”
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all
the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not
even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold
disappointment was worse than anything.

“Sir,” he said, a little desperately, “it isn’t that I wasn’t bothered or
anything, I’ve just had other — other things . . .”
“Other things on your mind,” Dumbledore finished the sentence for him.
“I see.”

Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry
had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on,
punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando
Dippet over Dumbledore’s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though
he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it
no longer he said, “Professor Dumbledore, I’m really sorry. I should have
done more. . . . I should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it
if it wasn’t really important.”

“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “May I
hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on?
There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that
memory.”

“I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly.
“Then we shall say no more about it just now,” said Dumbledore more
kindly, “but continue with our story where we left off. You remember where
that was?”

“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his father and his
grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he
went back to Hogwarts and he asked . . . he asked Professor Slughorn about
Horcruxes,” he mumbled shamefacedly.

“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Now, you will remember, I hope, that I
told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be
entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?”
“Yes, sir.”

“Thus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources
of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of
seventeen?”
Harry nodded.

“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things become murkier and
stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been
almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man
Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself,
who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts.
However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.”
Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the
Pensieve. “I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the
conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.”

The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel
even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the
Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised
the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.

“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s memories, for they
are curious recollections, these two,” he said. “This first one came from a
very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey
witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.
“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have
expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his
classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left
Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle,
prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School.

I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested
that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him
in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff
knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”
“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned.

“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. “I think you will
see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey’s
memory. But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job. Hardly anyone
knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster
confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked
whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.”

“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.
“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to
Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly,
Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever
been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and
only place he had felt at home.”

Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how
he felt about Hogwarts too.
“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly
Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the
students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were
still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.

“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence
over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from
Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had
demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for
an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at
Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a
place where he might begin to build himself an army.”
“But he didn’t get the job, sir?”

“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at
eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to
teach.”

“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry hesitantly.
“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised Armando against the
appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor
Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did
not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a
position of power.”

“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”
Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old
professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts
for nearly fifty years.

“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had
admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,
working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and
handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that
only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you
know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort
was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the
partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.”
“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.

“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. “And now it is time to
hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch
by the name of Hepzibah Smith.”

Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he
tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After
you, Harry.”

Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents
of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark
nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old
lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that
flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was
looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already
scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest houseelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d come at
four, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!”

She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The
top of the elf’s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah’s chair, and her
papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore
draped like a toga.

“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various
angles of her face in the mirror.
“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey.

Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract that she
must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah
Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.
A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.

“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out
of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see
how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at
least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes,
cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and
many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked
like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.

The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man
Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was
plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at
school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked
more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room
with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low
over Hepzibah’s fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.
“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from
nowhere.

“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old Hepzibah, though
Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little
table. “You do spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit down, sit down. . . . Where’s
Hokey? Ah . . .”

The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of
little cakes, which she set at her mistress’s elbow.
“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you love my cakes.
Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I’ve
said it a hundred times. . . .”

Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked, batting her
lashes.

“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made
armor,” said Voldemort. “Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than
fair —”
“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here for my trinkets!”
pouted Hepzibah.

“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort quietly. “I am only
a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to
inquire —”

“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. “I’ve
something to show you that I’ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a
secret, Tom? Will you promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke I’ve got it? He’d
never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you, and I’m not selling, not to
Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you’ll appreciate it for its history, not
how many Galleons you can get for it.”

“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” said Voldemort
quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.
“I had Hokey bring it out for me. . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to
show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. . . . In fact, bring both, while you’re at
it. . . .”

“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather
boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own
volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she
wended her way between tables, pouffes, and footstools.

“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them
in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, “I think you’ll like this,
Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can’t wait to
get their hands on this!”

She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and
saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.
“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good
look!” whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered
hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings.
Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression
was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s face, except that her tiny eyes were
fixed upon Voldemort’s handsome features.

“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the
cup. “Then this was . . . ?”

“Helga Hufflepuff’s, as you very well know, you clever boy!” said
Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually
pinching his hollow cheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was distantly descended?
This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn’t
it? And all sorts of powers it’s supposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested
them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .”

She hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long forefinger and restored it
gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to
notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort’s face as the cup was taken away.
“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? Oh yes, there you
are — take that away now, Hokey.”

The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention
to the much flatter box in her lap.
“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she whispered. “Lean in a
little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I’ve got this
one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he’d love to get it back when I’m
gone. . . .”

She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon
the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it
up to the light, staring at it.
“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate,
serpentine S.

“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of
Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. “I had to pay an arm and a leg
for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for
my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman
who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value —”
There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes flashed scarlet at
the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket’s chain.
“— I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn’t
it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice
and safe. . . .”

She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought
Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his
fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!”
She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her
foolish smile falter.
“Are you all right, dear?”

“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well. . . .”
“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose —” said Hepzibah,
looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary
red gleam in Voldemort’s eyes. “Here, Hokey, take these away and lock
them up again. . . . The usual enchantments . . .”
“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and as the little elf
bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again
above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to
Dumbledore’s office.

“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said Dumbledore,
resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. “Hokey the
house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening
cocoa by accident.”

“No way!” said Harry angrily.
“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. “Certainly, there are many
similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases,
somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having
caused the death —”

“Hokey confessed?”
“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned
out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison,” said Dumbledore.
“It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and
confused —”
“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!”
“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. “And, just as with
Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey —”

“— because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had rarely felt more in
sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.
“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she admitted to having
tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire
further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to
extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of course,
proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and
the locket.

“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family had realized that
two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure
of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her
collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the
cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin
and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and
charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had
no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his
disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle
for a very long time.

“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause
once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort
had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the
Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen,
he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies
that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the
other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s
ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and locket.”
“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad.  .  .  . Risking everything,
throwing away his job, just for those . . .”

“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “I hope
you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him,
Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the
locket, at least, as rightfully his.”
“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the cup as well?”
“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said Dumbledore.
“I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not
resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I
think. . . . I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.
“And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until
you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn’s memory for us. Ten years
separate Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only
guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .”

Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory
into the Pensieve.
“Whose memory is it?” he asked.
“Mine,” said Dumbledore.

And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass,
landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering
happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who
looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both
hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less
lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was
that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window
in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.

The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure
enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he
said, “Enter.”

Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His
features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone
cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were
not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer
handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and
blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes
now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits
that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak,
and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently
this visit had been made by appointment.

“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t you sit down?”
“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore
had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated
in the present. “I heard that you had become headmaster,” he said, and his
voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. “A worthy choice.”
“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “May I offer you a
drink?”

“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have come a long way.”
Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the
Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a
goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind
his desk.

“So, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I am known
as —”

“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly.
“But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the
irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”

He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal
to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell
that Voldemort took it as such.

“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never
wished to leave school.”

“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there
can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone
young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of
teaching too.”

“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are
so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been
offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the
Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in
common, I think.”

Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine.
Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but
waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.
“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, perhaps, than
Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request
again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to
ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must
know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show
and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.”
Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a
while before speaking.

“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since
leaving us,” he said quietly. “Rumors of your doings have reached your old
school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.”
Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness
inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this,
Dumbledore.”

“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked
Dumbledore delicately.
“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. “I have
experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than
they have ever been pushed —”

“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly. “Of some.
Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.”
For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more
threatening than a look of rage.
“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world
has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than
my kind of magic, Dumbledore.”

“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested
Dumbledore.
“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at
Hogwarts?” said Voldemort. “Will you let me return? Will you let me share
my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your
disposal. I am yours to command.”

Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will become of those whom
you command? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so
rumor has it — the Death Eaters?”
Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know
this name; he saw Voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils
flare.

“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will carry on without me,
I am sure.”
“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said Dumbledore. “I
was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.”
“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.

“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find a group
of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return?
Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely
to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.”
There could be no doubt that Dumbledore’s detailed knowledge of those
with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort;
however, he rallied almost at once.

“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.”
“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said Dumbledore lightly.
“Now, Tom . . .”

Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat,
the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.
“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by
henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?”
Voldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not want? On the
contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.”

“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach
any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you’re
after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?”
Voldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a job —”
“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t think for a moment
you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must
have had a purpose.”

Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his
features thick with rage. “This is your final word?”
“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing.
“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.”
“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. “The
time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and
force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I
wish I could. . . .”

For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He
was sure that Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his
wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the
door was closing, and he was gone.

Harry felt Dumbledore’s hand close over his arm again and moments
later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no
snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore’s hand was blackened
and dead-looking once more.

“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face. “Why
did he come back? Did you ever find out?”
“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”
“What ideas, sir?”

“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from
Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. “When you have that last piece of
the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.”
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had
walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at
once.

“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t
say. . . .”

“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said
Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we
have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for
longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”


CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE

THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM

arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the
nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did
increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping
that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he
had done so many times before.

“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday
evening.
“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron
wouldn’t be sitting here now.”
“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said
Hermione dismissively.

Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectumsempra!”)
scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For Enemies,” and was
itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead,
he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.

They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other
people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of
excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign
on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those
who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of
April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which
would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.

Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to
Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had
now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who
would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test
whether ready or not.

“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. “You’ll have no
trouble come July!”

“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to
disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.
Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was
now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and
Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low
marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to
tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most
important thing to him now.

“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is
illegal —”

“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a
spell. . . .”

“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can
get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade
Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him a
potion, anyone could do that —”

“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very hard
while staring at his parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”
“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her. “And
‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G either. What kind of quill are you
using?”

“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think the charm
must be wearing off. . . .”
“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, “because
we were asked how we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dugbogs,’ and I don’t
remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib’ either.”
“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. “Don’t say I’ll
have to write the whole thing out again!”
“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her
and taking out her wand.

“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his
eyes wearily.
Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear
you saying that.”
“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will . . . then she’ll ditch
me . . .”

“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.
“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho
just —”
“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.

“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily,
watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the
end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. “But the
more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like going out
with the giant squid.”

“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s
essay.
“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”

Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching
out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly
completed essay, and Harry said, “Kreacher!”
The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.
“Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing,
so Kreacher has come to give —”

Crack.
Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew.
“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting
Kreacher a resentful look. “And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is
coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!”
“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden
appearances. “What’s going on, Harry?”
Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione
about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always
such a touchy subject with her.
“Well . . . they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said.
“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher.
“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby proudly,
swaying where he stood.
Hermione looked indignant.

“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him not to
—”
“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, you can sleep, all
right? But has either of you found out anything?” he hastened to ask, before
Hermione could intervene again.
“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,”
croaked Kreacher at once. “His features recall the fine bones of my mistress
and his manners are those of —”
“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. “A bad boy who
— who —”

He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and
then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was
not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast.
For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.
“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it difficult to
speak ill of his old masters. . . .”

Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to
Kreacher, “But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good
master to a house-elf!”

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,”
Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy
eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends
his classes in a variety of —”

“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him
while he enters —”

“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him.
“That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s doing  .  .  .
whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s been disappearing off the
map — come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on
there!”

“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you
need it to be Unplottable, it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.

“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters
there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.”
“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy
already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that
stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the
headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room
becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to
transform into.”

“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve done
brilliantly, Dobby.”
“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from looking
grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the
ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he
cannot hear —”
“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep
bow and Disapparated. “You’d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.”
“Thank you, Harry Potter, sir!” squeaked Dobby happily, and he too
vanished.

“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and
Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. “We know where
Malfoy’s going! We’ve got him cornered now!”
“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the
sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay.
Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her
wand.

“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of
students’?” said Hermione. “How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t
think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing  .  .  . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was
a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any
time during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.

“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn
showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of
students standing guard for Malfoy  .  .  . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as
usual. . . . Yeah, it all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in
front of the fire. “They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he
won’t tell them what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen
lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking
Polyjuice to make them look like other people. . . . Those two girls I saw
him with when he missed Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”
“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that that little
girl whose scales I repaired — ?”

“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. “Of course! Malfoy
must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what am I talking
about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because
there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the
toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing
it!”

“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed Ron.
“Blimey  .  .  . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days.  .  .  . I’m
surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . .”
“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?”
said Harry.

“Hmmm  .  .  . the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione
skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to any more
harm and handing it to him.
“We’ll see,” said Harry confidently.

“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. “But,
Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into
the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there first. And I don’t
think you should forget” — she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave
him a very serious look — “that what you’re supposed to be concentrating
on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.”
Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the
girls’ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.
“What d’you think?”

“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at the spot
where Dobby had vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test in the bag.”
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours,
wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he,
Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever
Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the
headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy’s . . . what could
it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A workshop? Harry’s
mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were
broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who
turned into Snape. . . .

Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following
morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and
was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement.
Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered
plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he
thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.
“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily
Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from
opening it and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but
I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain
wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?”

“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said Hermione.
“It’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could
have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of
Requirement” — she jerked the Prophet out from under Harry’s hand and
unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go and find Slughorn
and start appealing to his better nature.”

“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.
“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their
breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus, he’s been
arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an
Inferius during an attempted burglary  .  .  . and someone called Octavius
Pepper has vanished.  .  .  . Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has
been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the
Imperius Curse. . . .”

They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for
Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his
conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and Harry for the corridor on the
seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the
Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.

Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty
passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he
found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside
the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first
attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or
Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.

He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of
Requirement’s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had
become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might
he thought, I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see what
Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . .
Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with
excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it —”

But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall.
He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained
solid and unyielding.
“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay . . . I thought the wrong thing. . . .”
He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating
as hard as he could.

I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . I need to
see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . .
After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.
There was no door.
“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was a clear
instruction. . . . Fine . . .”

He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more.
I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy. . . .
He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his
patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into
existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds
outside. He opened his eyes.
There was still no door.

Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of
first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression
that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.
Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing
inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he
was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room
simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for
Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and
stuffing it into his bag as he went.

“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit
classroom. “Ten points from Gryffindor.”
Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half
the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things;
he could not be much later than any of them.

“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his
wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air
and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I hope for your sakes they are
better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if
you will all open your books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?”
“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference
between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper
about an Inferius —”

“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice.
“But sir, I heard people talking —”
“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would
have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief
by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”
“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered
Harry to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been
arrest —”

“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape,
pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry.
“Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and
a ghost.”

The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what
Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
“Er — well — ghosts are transparent —” he said.
“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. “Yes, it is easy to see
that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you,
Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent.’”

Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were
smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides
were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies,
aren’t they? So they’d be solid —”

“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered Snape. “The
Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is
not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s bidding. A
ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed
soul left upon the earth  .  .  . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us,
transparent.”

“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them
apart!” said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley,
we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not
going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’”
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave
the class.

“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect
nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he
cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.”
“No!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his
mouth furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again,
leave it!”

“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape,
smirking a little, “and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse.
. . .”

Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the
end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione
mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly
for his jibe about Ron’s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron,
and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with
Harry.

“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after staring into a cracked
mirror for a minute or two. “I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test. I
just can’t get the hang of Apparition.”
“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see
where they get you,” said Harry reasonably. “It’ll be more interesting than
trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you’re still not — you
know — as good as you’d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with
me over the summ — Myrtle, this is the boys’ bathroom!”
The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and
was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round
glasses.

“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.”
“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.
“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. “He said
he’d come back and see me, but then you said you’d pop in and visit me
too” — she gave Harry a reproachful look — “and I haven’t seen you for
months and months. I’ve learned not to expect too much from boys.”
“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said Harry, who had been
careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.
“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that doesn’t mean I can’t
visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?”
“Vividly,” said Harry.
“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “Maybe if you two left,
he’d come back again. . . . We had lots in common. . . . I’m sure he felt it.
. . .”

And she looked hopefully toward the door.
“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, sounding rather
amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?”
“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled
bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely
and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s not afraid to show his feelings
and cry!”

“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously. “A young
boy?”
“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who
was now definitely grinning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I’ll
take his secret to the —”
“— not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The sewers, maybe
. . .”

Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water
to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have
put fresh heart into Ron.
“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder,
“I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the
test.”

And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the
sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight.
Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village;
he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one
of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had
decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of
Requirement.

“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and
her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get
that memory from him.”

“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had
lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner
Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry
had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and
knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure
he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been trying to
get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it happen!”

“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”
The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his
usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and
Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished
Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase
again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the
Room of Requirement.

Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map
and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he
tapped the map, murmured, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,”
and scanned it carefully.

As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their
various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in
another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement
near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the
library or up a corridor. . . . There were a few people out in the grounds . . .
and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There
was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about
that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the
map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing
down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to
creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy
brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He
waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and
whispering, “Hello . . . you’re very pretty, aren’t you?”

Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the
air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the
scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry
turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco
Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out
there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable
feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet
tried.

Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried
many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall
was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy
might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of
evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely,
Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.
“OUCH!”

He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on
one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.
“Harry?”

He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter
astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently
strolled up this corridor.
“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did
she always have to find him lying on the floor?
“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks.
Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored
hair lank.

“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other side of the castle,
behind the gargoyle —”
“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away again.”
“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor.
“Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose?”
“No,” said Tonks.

“What did you want to see him about?”
“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at
the sleeve of her robe. “I just thought he might know what’s going on. . . .
I’ve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . . .”
“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. “That little kid
trying to kill his —”
“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t seem to
be listening to him. “You haven’t had any letters from anyone in the Order
recently?”

“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry, “not since
Sirius —”
He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean  .  .  . I miss him, as well.
. . .”

“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. “Well . . .
I’ll see you around, Harry . . .”
And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving
Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility
Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of
Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his
stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for
lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who,
hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.

He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through
an early lunch.
“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he
caught sight of him. “I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam
Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft’s,
but at least I moved!”

“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”
“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione could
answer. “Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the
hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and
you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he
doesn’t pop the question soon —”

“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. “Have you been
up at the Room of Requirement all this time?”
“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!”
“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.
“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. . . .”
“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his
conversation with Tonks, “she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after
what happened at the Ministry.”

“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very
concerned. “She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly
abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even
here?”

“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it;
this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. “You don’t think she can
have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?”
Hermione stared at him.

“What on earth makes you say that?”
“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying when I
mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. . . .
I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . . you know . . . him.”
“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know why she’d
be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was
here. . . .”

“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling
mashed potato into his mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve.
Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily upset.”
“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt you’d find
a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t
laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus
mimbletonia.”
Ron scowled.


CHAPTER  TWELVE

PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE

eamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before
Harry had even put on his socks.
“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too
long?” asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped out of
sight.

“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag
onto his shoulder. “He’s just  .  .  .” But apparently he was unable to say
exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him
out of the room.

Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks, but
Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he going to
have to take?

“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up
with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed
toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s sake.”
She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large new
sign had been put up.

GALLONS OF GALLEONS!
Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?
Like to earn a little extra gold?
Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room, for
simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs
(WE REGRET THAT ALL WORK IS UNDERTAKEN AT APPLICANT’S OWN RISK)
“They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which
Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first
Hogsmeade weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them, Ron.”
Ron looked positively alarmed.

“Why?”
“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out through
the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!”
Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the
prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not
one that he found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked down
a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom
ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. “You look really
angry about something.”

“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who,” said Ron
succinctly, when Harry did not respond.
Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf,
sighed.

“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.
“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a lying,
attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly.
“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut
about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping
down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re on
your side.”

There was a short pause.
“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice.
“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her
head. “Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast
last year?”

Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed again.
“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and
enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond
of friendship and trust —’”

“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her in
admiration.
“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —”
“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing is
exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s only been
back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the
Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, be united —”
“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that means we’re
supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.”

“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of inter-House unity,”
said Hermione crossly.
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year
Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and
hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack
stragglers.

“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like
that,” said Harry sarcastically.
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking instinctively
at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to
Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again
conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed
Harry’s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud gray.

“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s
staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.
“Maybe . . .” said Hermione thoughtfully.
“What?” said both Harry and Ron together.
“Well . . . maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being
here.”

“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, half laughing. “How
could we not notice?”
Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided hair
had marched up to Harry.
“Hi, Angelina.”

“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an
answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.”
“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s pep talks
might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been, which could only
be an improvement.

“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on
Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we
can see how the new person’ll fit in.”
“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, sitting down
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. “I suppose that will
make quite a difference to the team?”
“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good
Keeper . . .”

“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through
the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and
packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of
water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen,
but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he
doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four
hours apart. Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside
quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily
Prophet in its beak.

“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking of
Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl’s leg
and it took off again. “I’m not bothering . . . load of rubbish.”
“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione darkly, and
she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until
Harry and Ron had finished eating.
“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down
by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.”
Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out
schedules.

“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions,
Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape,
Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and
George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . .”
“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and
squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely don’t
wish to skive off lessons?”

“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his schedule
under Fred’s nose. “That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.”
“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column. “You can have a
bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.”
“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously.
“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven’t got an
antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper.
“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think I’ll take
the lessons.”

“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing
Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor
notice board.”

“Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.”
“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily.
Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.
“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said Fred,
thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year, you’ll be
begging us for a Snackbox before long.”
“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?”
asked Hermione.

“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George.
“So?”
“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keeping
your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said Fred with
satisfaction.

“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said
George happily. “Tears and tantrums  .  .  . Patricia Stimpson kept coming
over faint . . .”
“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” said Fred
reminiscently.

“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said George.
“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten.  .  .  . Hard to keep track
sometimes, isn’t it?”
“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said George. “If you care
about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up
somehow.”

“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron.
“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our futures lie outside the
world of academic achievement.”

“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for
our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve got —”
He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been
about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.

“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily. “I mean, do
we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us leaving
school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s biggest prat.”
“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” said Fred, looking
affectionately around at the Great Hall. “We’re going to use it to do a bit of
market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student
requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research,
and then produce the products to fit the demand.”

“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?” asked
Hermione skeptically. “You’re going to need all the ingredients and
materials — and premises too, I suppose . . .”
Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped
his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, “Ask us
no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C’mon, George, if we get
there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before
Herbology.”

Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking
away, each carrying a stack of toast.
“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. “‘Ask
us no questions . . . ’ Does that mean they’ve already got some gold to start
a joke shop?”

“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said Ron, his brow
furrowed. “They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I
couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons . . .”
Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these
dangerous waters.
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because of
the exams?”

“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really
important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career
advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s
you want to do next year.”
“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked the
other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off toward
their History of Magic classroom.
“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except . . . well . . .”
He looked slightly sheepish.
“What?” Harry urged him.

“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand voice.
“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently.
“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to be really good.
What about you, Hermione?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like to do something
worthwhile.”

“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry.
“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said Hermione
thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .”
Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.

History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever
devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy,
droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within
ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied the form of their
lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather,
gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape
passes in this subject only by copying Hermione’s notes before exams; she
alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns’s voice.

Today they suffered three-quarters of an hour’s droning on the subject of
giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to
appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have
been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the
remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his
parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the
corner of her eye.

“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for
break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused to lend
you my notes this year?”
“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your conscience,
Hermione . . .”

“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen to
him, do you?”
“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your memory
or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub
it in?”

“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked slightly
mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles
around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the
collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about
what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had
got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult,
just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone
walked around the corner toward them.

“Hello, Harry!”
It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again. This
was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of
giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself
to ask her to the Yule Ball.
“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you’re not covered in
Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the
same lines.

“You got that stuff off, then?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last
meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. “So did you . . . er . . . have a
good summer?”

The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been Cho’s
boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday
almost as badly as it had affected Harry’s. . . . Something seemed to tauten
in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all right, you know . . .”
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at the
front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double
gold T was pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Cho.

“Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the
league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory
tone of voice.
“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . . see
you, Harry.”
She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the
courtyard before rounding on Ron.

“You are so tactless!”
“What? I only asked her if —”
“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”
“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —”
“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for?”
“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —”
“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”
“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought
them last season —”
“But what does it matter?”
“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the bandwagon
—”

“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione were
bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down
to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between
Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’ conversation
with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.

And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape’s
classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t she? She
had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming
out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking
to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a
liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she
had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second
time in two days  .  .  . and at this thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the
ominous sound of Snape’s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the
small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into
the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual
table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both
of them.

“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.
There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had
heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape’s
mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s silence.
“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his desk
and staring around at them all, “I think it appropriate to remind you that
next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you
will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of
magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I
expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in your O.W.L., or suffer my  .  .  .
displeasure.”

His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,”
Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class,
which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye.”
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a
grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth
year.

“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,”
said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not,
I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the highpass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe
agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you
will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you
will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.” On Harry’s left,
Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of the utmost
attentiveness. “The ingredients and method” — Snape flicked his wand —
“are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) — “you will find
everything you need” — he flicked his wand again — “in the store
cupboard” — (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an
hour and a half. . . . Start.”

Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly
have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be
added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture
had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then
in counterclockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was
simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number
of minutes before the final ingredient was added.
“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called
Snape, with ten minutes left to go.

Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding the
flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they had gone
out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of
silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it
without comment, which meant that he could find nothing to criticize. At
Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape stopped, looking down at Harry with a
horrible smirk on his face.

“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved
hearing Snape taunt Harry.
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”
Draco Malfoy laughed.
“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.
“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the
instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the
dungeon.

“‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to
simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.’”
His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded
straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to
simmer for seven minutes.
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”
“No,” said Harry very quietly.
“I beg your pardon?”

“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore . . .”
“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless.
Evanesco.”
The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly
beside an empty cauldron.
“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon
with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it
up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework: twelve inches of
parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to
be handed in on Thursday.”

While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his
things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which was now
giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had achieved the
consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to
gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving
zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and
slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape’s
desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell rang, Harry
was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time
Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an
even murkier gray during the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.
“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to
Harry and helping herself to shepherd’s pie. “Your potion wasn’t nearly as
bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and
set his robes on fire.”

“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since when has Snape
ever been fair to me?”
Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and
Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set
foot in Hogwarts.

“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said Hermione in a
disappointed voice. “I mean  .  .  . you know  .  .  .” She looked carefully
around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and
nobody was passing the table. “. . . Now he’s in the Order and everything.”
“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape,
where’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?”
“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he
doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.

“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his
mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and
offended. “Can’t you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always having a go at
each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his shepherd’s pie, he
swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there.
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many
students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared so
unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione’s
shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction. Serve them right,
he thought. Why can’t they give it a rest? . . . Bickering all the time . . . It’s
enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . .

He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir
Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored
him.

“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan in
a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on, and
when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighboring
picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking
wolfhound.

Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the
trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first to
ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney’s classroom when the
bell rang.

Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after Potions, which was due
mainly to Professor Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature death
every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering
with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect,
with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy putting copies
of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with
which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but so dim was
the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sicklyscented fire that she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the
shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes. Ron
emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted Harry and
made directly for him, or as directly as he could while having to wend his
way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs.

“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside
Harry.
“Good,” grunted Harry.
“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out
your temper on us,” said Ron.
“I’m not —”

“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking over him. “But I
reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you.”
“I never said it —”
“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice,
and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself
again. “And welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been following
your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that
you have all returned to Hogwarts safely — as, of course, I knew you
would.

“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by
Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining
the future and one that may very probably be tested in your O.W.L. Not, of
course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest
importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the
Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little. However, the
headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . .”
Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that
Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as
examinations.

“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the
matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use The Dream
Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry on.”
The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double
period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the
book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. At the table
next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately
embarked on a long-winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of
giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely
looked at each other glumly.

“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say one.”
“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently.
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly
well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need
Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him that. . . .
“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,” said Ron,
screwing up his face in an effort to remember. “What d’you reckon that
means?”

“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or
something,” said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without
interest.

It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry
was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping
a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron
led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.
“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set us a
foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of
moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from Trelawney!
Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were they? That
Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .”

When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they
found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk, wearing the
fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of
her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched
unwisely on top of an even larger toad.

The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as
yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian
she was likely to be.
“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had sat
down.

A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply.
“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, now, will it? I
should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’
One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”

“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That wasn’t too
difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.”

Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away” had
never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry
shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, and
parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own
wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply
with it; words appeared on the board at once:

Defense Against the Dark Arts
A Return to Basic Principles
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and
fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class
with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant changing of
teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministryapproved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the
standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.

“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to
be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered,
Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the
following, please.”

She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was
replaced by:
Course aims:
1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can
legally be used.
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.

For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching
quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor
Umbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”

There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I ask you
a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or ‘No,
Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical
Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”

“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room.
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to page five
and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.”
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair
behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad’s
eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory
and started to read.

It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He
felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same
line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words.
Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absentmindedly
turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the
page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his
torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical
Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the
air.

Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when
instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came
under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she merely shook her
head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and
continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as
resolutely in another direction.

After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only
one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was
so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione’s
mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye than to struggle on with
“Basics for Beginners.”

When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at
their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the
situation no longer.

“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she asked
Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.
“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing her
small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with them at the
end of class.”

“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
“And your name is — ?”
“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you
read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of
determined sweetness.

“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written up there
about using defensive spells.”
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned
their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little
laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that
would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. —
?”

“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.

“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked
Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
“No, but —”

“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ‘whole
point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have
devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked it
won’t be in a —”

“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away
from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too.
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.
“Dean Thomas.”

“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be
attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at
Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
“No, but —”

Professor Umbridge talked over him.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,”
she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, “but you have
been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very
irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty little laugh,
“extremely dangerous half-breeds.”
“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily, “he was
the best we ever —”

“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced to
spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and
potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are
likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”
“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —”
“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!”

Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her.
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal
curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas hotly.
“Mind you, we still learned loads —”

“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge. “Now, it
is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than
sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what
school is all about. And your name is?” she added, staring at Parvati, whose
hand had just shot up.

“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against the
Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the
countercurses and things?”
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason
why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled
examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge dismissively.
“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati incredulously. “Are
you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be during our
exam?”

“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —”
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry
loudly, his fist in the air again.
Professor Umbridge looked up.
“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she said softly.
“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there?”
“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling
just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?” inquired
Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.
“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice, “maybe
Lord Voldemort?”

Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped
sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She
was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either
Umbridge or Harry.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”
Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubbyfingered hands splayed on her desk.
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the
dead —”

“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s returned!”
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-makematters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor Umbridge in one breath without
looking at him. “As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain
Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.”
“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!”
“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly.
“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark
wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class
hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I
would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now,
you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’”
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, however,
stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared, halffascinated.
“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his
sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord,
did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.

There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them,
apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had
happened on the night that Cedric had died. They stared avidly from Harry
to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him
without a trace of a fake smile on her face.

“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly.
“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had
hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening
classmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”
Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he thought she
was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly
girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”

He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the
teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt
so angry he did not care what happened next.
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her
handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink,
and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she
was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she rolled up the
parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he
could not open it.

“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Umbridge,
holding out the note to him.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even
looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut
behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall
clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the
Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man floating on his back in midair, juggling
several inkwells.

“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls
with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.
“Get out of it, Peeves.”

“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry along
the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it this time,
my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in” —
Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?”
“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the nearest
flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside
him.

“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad,
But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad,
But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad —”
“SHUT UP!”

A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her
office looking grim and slightly harassed.
“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as Peeves
cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in class?”
“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.
“Sent? What do you mean, sent?”
He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall
took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it
out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their
square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each
line they became narrower.
“Come in here, Potter.”
He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically behind
him.

“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this true?”
“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had
intended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“You called her a liar?”
“Yes.”
“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”
“Yes.”
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry.
Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.”
“Have — what?”
“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of
cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit
down.”

There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned
by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the
Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and helped
himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he
had done on that occasion.
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and looked
very seriously at Harry.
“Potter, you need to be careful.”
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her tone
of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp, and
stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.
“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much more
than House points and a detention.”
“What do you — ?”

“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor McGonagall, with
an abrupt return to her usual manner. “You know where she comes from,
you must know to whom she is reporting.”
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the
elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting
tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge’s note
again.

“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. “But, Professor,
couldn’t you — ?”
“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly.
“But —”

“She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will
go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember:
Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.”
“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s back,
you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is —”
“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening
her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort’s
name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s about keeping
your head down and your temper under control!”

She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too.
“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.
“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped.
He took one.
“Thanks,” he said grudgingly.
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-term
feast, Potter?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohibited
or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere
at Hogwarts.”

Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked
around her desk, and held open the door for him.
“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she said,
pointing him out of her office.


CHAPTER  THIRTEEN

DETENTION WITH DOLORES

inner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for
Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge seemed to
have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He heard
whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The
funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him
overhearing what they were saying about him — on the contrary, it was as
though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so
that they could hear his story firsthand.
“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered . . .”
“He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who . . .”
“Come off it . . .”

“Who does he think he’s kidding?”
“Pur-lease . . .”
“What I don’t get,” said Harry in a shaking voice, laying down his knife
and fork (his hands were trembling too much to hold them steady), “is why
they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told
them . . .”
“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said Hermione grimly. “Oh,
let’s get out of here.”
She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his halffinished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of
the Hall.

“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?” Harry
asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.
“Look, you don’t understand what it was like after it happened,” said
Hermione quietly. “You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching
Cedric’s dead body. . . . None of us saw what happened in the maze. . . . We
just had Dumbledore’s word for it that You-Know-Who had come back and
killed Cedric and fought you.”

“Which is the truth!” said Harry loudly.
“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?” said
Hermione wearily. “It’s just that before the truth could sink in, everyone
went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about
how you’re a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!”

Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty
corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day had
lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A
dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He glanced out of a
rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady’s
corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid’s cabin.

“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask.
The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the three of them
scrambled back through it.

The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at
dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet
them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their three
favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly into Hermione’s lap and curled
up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling
drained and exhausted.

“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried suddenly,
making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.
She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out
of the holes. “How can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our
O.W.L. year too!”

“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers,
have we?” said Harry. “You know what it’s like, Hagrid told us, nobody
wants the job, they say it’s jinxed.”
“Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing to let us do magic!
What’s Dumbledore playing at?”
“And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said Ron darkly.
“Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear
anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back?”

“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would
Fudge have wanted her to come?” snapped Hermione.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth
to retaliate. “Can’t we just . . . Let’s just do that homework, get it out of the
way . . .”
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs
by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry kept his face
averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares he was
attracting.

“Shall we do Snape’s stuff first?” said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink.
“‘The properties  .  .  . of moonstone  .  .  . and its uses  .  .  . in potionmaking  .  .  .’” he muttered, writing the words across the top of his
parchment as he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then looked
up expectantly at Hermione.

“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?”
But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far
corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at
the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were
chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that
Fred was holding.

“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, standing up and looking
positively furious. “Come on, Ron.”
“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — come on,
Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets . . .”
“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or —
or Puking Pastilles or —”

“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested quietly.
One by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the first
years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right onto the
floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling
out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however,
squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George
now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first years.
Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two,
then muttered to Harry, “She’s got it under control,” before sinking as low
in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.
“That’s enough!” Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of
whom looked up in mild surprise.
“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this dosage looks strong
enough, doesn’t it?”

“I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students!”
“We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly.
“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!”
“Rubbish,” said Fred.
“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!” said Lee reassuringly as he
walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their open
mouths.
“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George.
A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so shocked
to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry
was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going
to do.
“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at
his feet.

“I-I think so,” she said shakily.
“Excellent,” said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had
snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his
hands.
“It is NOT excellent!”
“’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred angrily.
“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?”
“We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on
ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same —”
“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —”
“Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.
“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking.
Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to
her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to
crackle with electricity.
“No,” she said, her voice quivering with anger, “but I will write to your
mother.”

“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.
“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione grimly. “I can’t stop you eating the
stupid things yourselves, but you’re not giving them to first years.”
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as they
were concerned, Hermione’s threat was way below the belt. With a last
threatening look at them, she thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag of Fancies
back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire.
Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his
knees.

“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said acidly.
“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled.
Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds,
then said edgily, “Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now. I’m going to
bed.”

She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her
books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects,
placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few
screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and stood back to admire
the effect.

“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said Ron, watching her as
though fearful for her sanity.
“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now stuffing her books
back into her bag. “I did them over the summer. I’m a really slow knitter
without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be able to make lots
more.”

“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And
you’re covering them up with rubbish first?”
“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back.
“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to trick them into
picking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not want to
be free.”

“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though her face
was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!”
She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the
girls’ dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.
“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly.
“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title
of Snape’s essay. “There’s no point trying to finish this now, I can’t do it
without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re supposed to do with
moonstones, have you?”

Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right
temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant wars and
the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that he would
regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morning came, he piled
his books back into his bag.

“I’m going to bed too.”
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but
did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had
opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of
the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one.
Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.
“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly.
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She looked
mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to
be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have gone. Seems the houseelves do want freedom after all.”
“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They might not count as
clothes. They didn’t look anything like hats to me, more like woolly
bladders.”

Hermione did not speak to him all morning.
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor
Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of
their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeakily,
perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his
desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years
to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now
is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m afraid, we shall be working
harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!”
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms,
which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their
O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount
of Charms homework ever.

It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly,
“without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why
everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as
long as they put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise.
“Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There’s nothing
wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So  .  .  . today we are
starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which
you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among
the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.”

She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult.
By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish
the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said hopefully that he
thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully
vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for
Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given
homework; everybody else was told to practice the spell overnight, ready
for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon.

Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do,
Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of
moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s slur on her woolly
hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they reached Care of Magical
Creatures in the afternoon, Harry’s head was aching again.

The day had become cool and breezy, and, as they walked down the
sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest,
they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank
stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid’s front door, a long
trestle table in front of her laden with many twigs. As Harry and Ron
reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they
saw Draco Malfoy striding toward them, surrounded by his usual gang of
Slytherin cronies. He had clearly just said something highly amusing,
because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger
heartily as they gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all
of them kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the
joke without too much difficulty.

“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the
Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. “Let’s crack on then — who can tell
me what these things are called?”

She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione’s hand shot into
the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her
jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. Pansy Parkinson
gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the
twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what
looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown
arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny,
flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.

“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry:
Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impressive
creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the
salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the BlastEnded Skrewts perhaps too much so.
“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-Plank
sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the
stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. “So — anyone know
the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?”

“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “They’re tree-guardians, usually live in
wand-trees.”
“Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these
are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in
trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?”
“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry
had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. “But fairy eggs if they can
get them.”

“Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves or
wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of
wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but
if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers, which, as you
can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you’d
like to gather closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle — I have
enough here for one between three — you can study them more closely. I
want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the
lesson.”

The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately
circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-
Plank.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing
bowtruckles.

“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had
been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too.
Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and
seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear
him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.”
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of his
mouth.

“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you get my
drift.”
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who suddenly
felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death Eater, after
all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that had not yet reached
the Order’s ears? He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione,
who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to
persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it. Harry pulled
out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a
whisper what Malfoy had just said.

“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,” said
Hermione at once. “It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it
tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to ignore him,
Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its
face . . .”

“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them, “Father
was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it
sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on
substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does
show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.”
“OUCH!”

Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped; it
had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers,
leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it; Crabbe and Goyle, who
had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still
harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, moving
stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots. When the bell echoed
distantly over the grounds Harry rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle
picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in a
handkerchief of Hermione’s and Malfoy’s derisive laughter still ringing in
his ears.

“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .” snarled Harry.
“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a prefect
now, he could make life difficult for you . . .”
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry
sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they traipsed
across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to make up its
mind whether it wanted to rain or not.

“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said Harry in
a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. “And don’t say that GrubblyPlank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly.
“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly.
“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully
aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures
lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years spilled
out of it, including Ginny.

“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna
Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth
on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she saw
Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a
beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch.
Luna took a great breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary
hello: “I believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you
fought him and escaped from him.”

“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what looked like
a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender
seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing at her
earlobes.

“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the
impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said
rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there were
no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned
Snorkack!”
“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently. “There
weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the CrumpleHorned Snorkack.”
Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging
madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter
now.

“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” Harry
asked Hermione as they made their way into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,” said
Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only believe in
things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect anything
else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.”
Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he
had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too. His spirits sank
slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could devote much more
thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him.
“I want you to know, Potter,” he said in a loud, carrying voice, “that it’s
not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred
percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do
I.”

“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken aback but pleased.
Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood
to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not
wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie’s words had certainly wiped the smile
from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione,
Harry caught Seamus’s expression, which looked both confused and
defiant.

To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing
them about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the teachers would
stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in his
stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a
feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet
another essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon
dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors
trooped back up to the castle, none of them talking very much; it had been
another long day.

As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at
five o’clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in
Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing
whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached the entrance of the
Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, “Oy, Potter!”
“What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson,
who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and poking
him hard in the chest with her finger. “How come you’ve landed yourself in
detention for five o’clock on Friday?”

“What?” said Harry. “Why . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!”
“Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted to do
a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with
everyone? Didn’t I tell you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And
now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!”

“I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice of
these words. “I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I
told her the truth about You-Know-Who —”
“Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on
Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her
You-Know-Who’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure
you’re there!”
She stormed away.

“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the
Great Hall. “I think we’d better check with Puddlemere United whether
Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session, because she seems to
be channeling his spirit.”

“What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on
Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his plate
and starting to eat. “Better try, though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do two more
detentions or something, I dunno . . .” He swallowed a mouthful of potato
and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too long this evening. You realize
we’ve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall,
work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the bowtruckle drawing, and
start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?”

Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.”
“What’s that got to do with our homework?” said Hermione, her
eyebrows raised.

“Nothing,” said Ron at once, his ears reddening.
At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for
Umbridge’s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door she said,
“Come in,” in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around.
He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In the
days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in
beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely
you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you
came to call. In the impostor Moody’s days it had been packed with various
instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment.
Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had all
been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of
dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a
collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large Technicolored
kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that
Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.”

Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first because
she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well
with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.
“Evening,” Harry said stiffly.

“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small table draped in lace
beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank
parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.
“Er,” said Harry, without moving. “Professor Umbridge? Er — before we
start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor.”
Her bulging eyes narrowed.
“Oh yes?”

“Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed
to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was
— was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it — do
it another night . . . instead . . .”
He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no
good.

“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she
had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no. This is your
punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, Mr. Potter,
and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one’s
convenience. No, you will come here at five o’clock tomorrow, and the next
day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think
it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do.
It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.”

Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his
ears. So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he?
She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling
widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting
to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive effort Harry
looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed
chair, and sat down.

“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better at controlling our
temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for
me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry bent down to
open his bag. “You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here
you are.”

She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.
“I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies,’” she told him softly.
“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of
politeness.
“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge
sweetly. “Off you go.”
She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of
parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp black
quill and then realized what was missing.

“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said.
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge with the merest
suggestion of a laugh in her voice.
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell
lies.

He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in
what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the words had
appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his skin as though
traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin
healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than
before but quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide,
toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”

“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more,
wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand
for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once
again they healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment
in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again
and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then
reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when he
would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she
was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any,
not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open his own hand with this
quill. . . .

“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.
He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked down at it
he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.
“Hand,” she said.

He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder as she
touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of
ugly old rings.

“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,” she
said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t
we? You may go.”
Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it
was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then, when he
had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear him, broke into
a run.

He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a single
dream in his dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of the
bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next
morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their
first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron keeping him
company.

“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, as Ron stared
wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast
asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about
“doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and scrawled a few
words.

“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, “I’ve said I
dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything weird
out of that, can she?”
They hurried off to North Tower together.
“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you
do?”

Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, “Lines.”
“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron.
“Nope,” said Harry.
“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?”
“No,” said Harry.
Ron groaned sympathetically.

It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in
Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give
up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and
meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave them
yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening
because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina
Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would
not be able to attend Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all
impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to
remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.
“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. “D’you
think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?”
“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back
onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie, which he no
longer fancied very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful punishment,
really . . .”

Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not really
sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening
in Umbridge’s room: He only knew that he did not want to see their looks
of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more
difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and
Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the
satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.
“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said Ron miserably.
“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him. “Where
were you anyway?”

“I was . . . I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily.
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing
things at the moment.
The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the
back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed;
Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the
cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be
satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, however, and from the
moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past
midnight, he said nothing but “Good evening” and “Good night.”

His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he
returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go
to bed, but opened his books and began Snape’s moonstone essay. It was
half-past two by the time he had finished it. He knew he had done a poor
job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he
would be in detention with Snape next. He then dashed off answers to the
questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something
on the proper handling of bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and
staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and
fell asleep immediately.

Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too,
though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry’s third detention
passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the
words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of Harry’s hand, but
remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the
pointed quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge look up.
“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand
herself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it? You
may leave for tonight.”

“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up his
schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes, I
think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s work.”
He had never before considered the possibility that there might be
another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked
back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a contender.
She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an
evil, twisted, mad, old —
“Ron?”

He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into
Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his
broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise when he saw Harry and
attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven behind his back.
“What are you doing?”
“Er — nothing. What are you doing?”
Harry frowned at him.

“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?”
“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said Ron.
“They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re testing stuff
on them again, I mean, they can’t do it in the common room now, can they,
not with Hermione there.”
He was talking in a very fast, feverish way.
“But what have you got your broom for, you haven’t been flying, have
you?” Harry asked.

“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron said
defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try out for
Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.”
“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea! It’d be
really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play Keeper, are you
good?”

“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s
reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them when
they were training during the holidays.”
“So you’ve been practicing tonight?”
“Every evening since Tuesday  .  .  . just on my own, though, I’ve been
trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy and I don’t
know how much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and anxious. “Fred and
George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts.
They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a
prefect.”

“I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as they set off
together toward the common room.
“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s that on the back of your hand?”
Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to
hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s —”
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of Harry’s
hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which he stared at
the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry, looking sick.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?”

Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told
Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge’s office.
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in
front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her
frame. “She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!”
“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing
she’s got to me.”

“Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this!”
“I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her,” said Harry.
“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!”
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Why not?”
“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the true
reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore
had not spoken to him once since last June.

“Well, I reckon you should —” Ron began, but he was interrupted by the
Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, “Are
you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night
waiting for you to finish your conversation?”
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry
glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered the Great Hall,
it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he turned his mind
immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of
homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with
Umbridge.

Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was
almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention
with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch
from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron’s
tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was
grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never
had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.

At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s office
door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter
and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered
table, the pointed black quill beside it.
“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, smiling sweetly over
at him.

Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just
shifted his chair an inch or so to the right  .  .  . On the pretext of shifting
himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of the
Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a
dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently
awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at
this distance.

I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand
opened and began to bleed afresh.
I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.
I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist.
He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending
the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored
twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very much that the
Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with
blood.

I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, when he could hear
the scratching of Umbridge’s quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The
third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth
dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The
sky was darkening so that Harry doubted he would be able to watch the
sixth and seventh people at all.

I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
The parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back of his
hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up, night had
fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.
“Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?” said Umbridge’s
soft voice half an hour later.
She moved toward him, stretching out her short be-ringed fingers for his
arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into
his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but across the scar on
his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere
around his midriff.

He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her.
She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.
“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly.
He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was she
talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead?
“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.”
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could.
Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it
doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means. . . .
“Mimbulus mimbletonia!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung
forward once more.

A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him, beaming all
over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was
clutching.
“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!”
“What? Oh — brilliant!” said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his
heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I can’t believe it —
where’s Hermione gone?”

“She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and pointed
to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping
precariously in her hand.
“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said Ron, looking
slightly put out.
“Let her sleep,” said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry
noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore
unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds.

“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver’s old robes fit you,” called Katie
Bell. “We can take off his name and put yours on instead . . .”
As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.
“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she said abruptly. “It’s
stressful, this managing lark, you know, I’m starting to think I was a bit
hard on Wood sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the rim of her
goblet with a slight frown on her face.
“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said
bluntly. “I think with a bit of training he’ll be all right, though. He comes
from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him turning out to
have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher
and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper’s a real
whiner, he’s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky’s
involved in all sorts of societies, she admitted herself that if training clashed
with her Charm Club she’d put Charms first. Anyway, we’re having a
practice session at two o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there
this time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?”
He nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved
over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.

“Oh, Harry, it’s you.  .  .  . Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she said blearily.
“I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned. “I was up until one o’clock
making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!”
And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly
hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally
pick them up.
“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he
would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office and she
touched my arm . . .”
Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished she said slowly,
“You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he controlled
Quirrell?”

“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. “But I
don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean,
he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t
need to share someone else’s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse,
I suppose . . .”

Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer
bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, “But last year your scar hurt
when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say it had to do
with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this
hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it’s just coincidence
it happened while you were with her?”
“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.”
“She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore
your scar hurt.”

It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to
Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to
Ron.
“I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big deal.
It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse tonight,
that’s all —”

“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this —”
“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, “that’s the only bit of
me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar?”
“Don’t say that, it’s not true!”
“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —”
“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” said Hermione,
looking alarmed. “Don’t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what
we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t being intercepted
anymore!”

“All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then!” said Harry irritably. He got to
his feet. “I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?”
“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re going that means I
can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and I want to make
some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it’s quite
fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things
now.”

Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look
as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.
“Er . . . no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said. “Er — not tomorrow.
I’ve got loads of homework to do . . .”
And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her looking slightly
disappointed behind him.


CHAPTER  FOURTEEN

PERCY AND PADFOOT

arry was the first to awake in his dormitory next morning. He lay for
a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling
through the gap in his four-poster’s hangings and savored the thought that it
was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on forever,
like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.

Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of
sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his
bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant
twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors.
He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill, and
headed out of the dormitory for the common room.

Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now
extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his
parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits
of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, and candy wrappers
that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as
were all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now
been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink
bottle, dipped his quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the
smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a
minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete
loss for what to say.

He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to
write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius
everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions
he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of
information he did not want them to have?
He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally
coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and
set it resolutely upon the parchment.

Dear Snuffles,
Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been terrible, I’m really
glad it’s the weekend.
We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor
Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as your mum. I’m writing because that
thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when
I was doing a detention with Umbridge.
We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon.
Please write back quickly.

Best,
Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point of
view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was
talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading this letter.
He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when
he might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too
much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at
Hogwarts.

Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write;
sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on
it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories
above. Sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole
and headed off for the Owlery.
“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick,
drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked down
the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass
the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.”
“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?” asked
Harry.

“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice.
“Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point. I’m off to try and find the
Bloody Baron.  .  .  . He might be able to put a stop to it.  .  . . See you,
Harry . . .”

“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left,
taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he
walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had
training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last —
Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker’s
skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike
yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of
Wilfred the Wistful.

“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after her. She had the
unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could
not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a
Saturday morning.

The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the
glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight
crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters,
a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly just returned from
hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny
animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.
“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the
vaulted ceiling. “Get down here, I’ve got a letter for you.”
With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down
onto his shoulder.

“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he told her, giving her
the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why,
whispering, “but it’s for Sirius, okay?”
She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she
understood.
“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows;
with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly
bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and
vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly visible from this
window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the
curtains drawn.

The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry
watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch
later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the
ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide
like a pterodactyl’s, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It
soared in a great circle and then plunged once more into the trees. The
whole thing had happened so quickly Harry could hardly believe what he
had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.

The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turning
quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.
“Hi,” said Harry automatically.
“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think anyone would be up
here this early.  .  .  . I only remembered five minutes ago, it’s my mum’s
birthday.”

She held up the parcel.
“Right,” said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say
something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged
horse was fresh in his mind.
“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to
shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the
weather. . . .

“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. “Good Quidditch
conditions. I haven’t been out all week, have you?”
“No,” said Harry.

Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down onto
her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.
“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you know him?”
“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he any good?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I didn’t see his tryout, though, I was in
detention.”

Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl’s legs.
“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low voice. “Putting you in
detention just because you told the truth about how — how — how he died.
Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. You were really brave
standing up to her like that.”

Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually
float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid
flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave. . . . For a moment he
considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped
her tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very instant that this thrilling
thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.

Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were purple
patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin
gray hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting
at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There
was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl snapped
his beak in a menacing fashion.

“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his pouchy
cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to
place a massive order for Dungbombs!”
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?”
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her
arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored
it.

“I have my sources,” said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. “Now hand over
whatever it is you’re sending.”
Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the
letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.”
“Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage.
“Gone,” said Harry calmly.
Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked
Harry’s robes with his eyes. “How do I know you haven’t got it in your
pocket?”

“Because —”
“I saw him send it,” said Cho angrily.
Filch rounded on her.
“You saw him — ?”
“That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely.
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho
glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the
door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry.
“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .”
He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at
the owls and followed him.
Harry and Cho looked at each other.
“Thanks,” Harry said.

“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl’s other
leg, her face slightly pink. “You weren’t ordering Dungbombs, were you?”
“No,” said Harry.
“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, as she carried the
owl to the window.
Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was, though,
oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment.
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led
toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way. Well,
I’ll . . . I’ll see you around, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . see you.”

She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly elated. He
had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed
himself once. . . . You were really brave standing up to her like that. . . . She
had called him brave. . . . She did not hate him for being alive. . . .
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that. . . . Though if he’d
only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out
differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse when
Harry had asked her. . . .

“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining them at the
Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said Ron, eyeing Harry in
surprise.
“Erm . . . Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of
bacon and eggs toward him.

“Oh . . . yeah . . .” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was eating
and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, “Listen . . . you don’t
fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to — er — give me some
practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit . . .”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry.

“Look, I don’t think you should,” said Hermione seriously, “you’re both
really behind on homework as it —”
But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily
Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed
perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; Hermione pushed a
Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page
critically as the owl took off again.

“Anything interesting?” said Ron; Harry smiled — he knew Ron was
keen to get her off the subject of homework.
“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass player in the Weird
Sisters getting married . . .”

She opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself
to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at the high
windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!”
“What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so violently
that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione were holding half
each.

“‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that
Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently
hiding in London!’” Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.
“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious voice.
“He did recognize Sirius on the platform . . .”
“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —”
“Shh!” said the other two.

“.  .  .  ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very
dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .’ the usual
rubbish,” Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and
looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. “Well, he just won’t be able to leave the
house again, that’s all,” she whispered. “Dumbledore did warn him not to.”
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off. Most
of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame Malkin’s Robes
for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could both see
it. “Look at this!”

“I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron.
“No,” said Harry, “look . . . this little piece here . . .”
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch
long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was headlined:

TRESPASS AT MINISTRY
Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham,
has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and
attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. Podmore
was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who
found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at
one o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak in his own
defense, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in
Azkaban.

“Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly, “but he’s that bloke who looks like
his head’s been thatched, isn’t he? He’s one of the Ord —”
“Ron, shh!” said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.
“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked. “Just for trying to
get through a door!”

“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through a door — what on
earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in the morning?”
breathed Hermione.
“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” Ron muttered.
“Wait a moment . . .” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was supposed to come
and see us off, remember?”
The other two looked at him.

“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King’s Cross,
remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn’t turn up, so that
doesn’t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them, does it?”
“Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” said Hermione.

“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly. “No — listen!” he
went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on
Hermione’s face. “The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s lot so
— I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t trying to get
through a door at all! Maybe they’ve just made something up to get him!”
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. Harry
thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather
impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that
were true.”

She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry laid
down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie.
“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on SelfFertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start
McGonagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch . . .”
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework
awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had
not been on his Firebolt all week. . . .

“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked down
the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their
shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s
still ringing in their ears. “And we’ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up
about work, that’s her trouble . . .” There was a pause and he added, in a
slightly more anxious tone, “D’you think she meant it when she said we
weren’t copying from her?”

“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, we’ve got to
practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team . . .”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we have got
plenty of time to do it all . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.

They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to
work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and
trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he
blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and
played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they
returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made
it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the
Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but
Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered.
“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down
to the pitch.

“Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?” said Fred, emerging touslehaired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his
face.
“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the
first time. They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood’s,
who was rather broader in the shoulder.

“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the Captain’s office,
already changed. “Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the
ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching
but I want you to just ignore them, all right?”

Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might
know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when they left
the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of
catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangerson, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices
echoed loudly around the stadium.

“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl.
“Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that?”
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with
laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry
followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll see
who’s laughing after we play them . . .”

“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly, soaring
around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the
spot in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re going to start
with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please —”
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyone want to look like they’ve got
worms coming out of their head?”

Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said calmly,
“Spread out, then, and let’s see what we can do . . .”
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell
back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand
and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who
passed to Ron, who dropped it.

The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron,
who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed,
pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom,
and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George
exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for
which he was grateful.

“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed
to George. . . .

“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. “Sure you don’t
need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the
hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?”
Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not been
expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it
quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.
“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the ground
again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay attention.”

It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or the Quaffle was a
deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy and the rest
of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.
On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he
passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie’s
outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.
“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had done any
damage.

“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina. “But as you’re
passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t you?
We’ve got Bludgers for that!”

Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamping
their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.
“Here, take this,” Fred told her, handing her something small and purple
from out of his pocket. “It’ll clear it up in no time.”
“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats and a
Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch when I say
so. We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.”

Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered George, as
the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to
extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “He was fine when I was practicing with
him this morning.”

“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.
They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry released
the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on,
Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It was his job to
recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty
points to the Seeker’s team and doing so required enormous speed and skill.
He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm
autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much
meaningless roaring in his ears. . . . But too soon, the whistle brought him
to a halt again.

“Stop — stop — STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — you’re not
covering your middle post!”
Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand
hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
“Oh . . . sorry . . .”

“You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers!” said
Angelina. “Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a
hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one side, that’s
how you let in the last three goals!”
“Sorry . . .” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the
bright blue sky.

“And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed?”
“It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow
with her sleeve.
Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his
pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it for a second,
and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck.
“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slytherins,
who had now set up a chant of “Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are
losers,” but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom
nevertheless.

This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelina’s
whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the
opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.
“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.
“Katie,” she said shortly.

Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast as
they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward her too. It was plain
that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk-white
and covered in blood.

“She needs the hospital wing,” said Angelina.
“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She — er — might have swallowed a Blood
Blisterpod by mistake —”
“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,”
said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward the castle
supporting Katie between them. “Come on, let’s go and get changed.”
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing
rooms.

“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as
Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor
common room.

“It was —” Harry began.
“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair
beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt.
“Well, it was only your first one,” she said consolingly, “it’s bound to
take time to —”
“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped Ron.
“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I thought —”
“You thought I was bound to be rubbish?”
“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just —”
“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said Ron angrily and
stomped off to the staircase to the boys’ dormitories and vanished from
sight. Hermione turned to Harry.

“Was he lousy?”
“No,” said Harry loyally.
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but it was
only the first training session, like you said . . .”
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their
homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly
he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having
difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out of his head.

They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their
books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It was another
clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the
grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year.
By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain
against the inside of his skull.

“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during
the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor
McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned
miserably to Professor Sinistra’s equally long and difficult essay about
Jupiter’s moons.

“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth
spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. “Listen . . . shall we just
ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done?”
Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap
and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair
in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.

“No,” he said heavily, “you know she won’t let us.”
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became
steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again.
At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.
“Nearly done?”

“No,” said Ron shortly.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said, pointing
over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s Io that’s got
the volcanos.”
“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.
“Sorry, I only —”
“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —”
“Ron —”
“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m up to
my neck in it here —”
“No — look!”

Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both
looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill,
gazing into the room at Ron.
“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed.
“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to
his feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?”
He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed
upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron
took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across
Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.

“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into his
chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To Ronald
Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other two.
“What d’you reckon?”
“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the
parchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl. When
he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at Harry
and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it together:
Dear Ron,

I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister of
Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge)
that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.

I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must
firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been
afraid that you would take what we might call the “Fred and George”
route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my
feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have
decided to shoulder some real responsibility.

But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to
give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather
than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will be able to read this
away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions.

From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a
prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must
tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your
badge more than continued fraternization with that boy. Yes, I am sure
you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say that Potter has
always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but I feel bound to tell you that
Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the
people who count have a very different — and probably more accurate
— view of Potter’s behavior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at
the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the
wind is blowing — and see if you can spot yours truly!

Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as
Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am
talking here about life after school too. As you must be aware, given
that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing
this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out
of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality if you ask me
and many of the people I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.

It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I know that
he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent — but if you have
any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter’s
behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores
Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will be only too
happy to advise you.

This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above,
Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty,
Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very
sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering very little
cooperation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes
within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she
should find this easier from next week — again, see the Prophet
tomorrow!). I shall say only this — a student who shows himself
willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for
Head Boyship in a couple of years!

I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It
pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live
under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd
around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you
might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of
Dumbledore’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the
Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty
criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders). I count
myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such
people — the Minister really could not be more gracious to me — and
I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the
misguided nature of our parents’ beliefs and actions either. I sincerely
hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall,
of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.
Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the
bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming
prefect.

Your brother,
Harry looked up at Ron.
“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a
joke, “if you want to — er — what is it?” (He checked Percy’s letter.) “Oh
yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent.”

“Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is —” Ron said
jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into quarters
— “biggest” — he tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the pieces into the
fire.

“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,” he
said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra’s essay back toward him.
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face.
“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly.
“What?” said Ron.

“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she said.
“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you’re a lifesaver,” said Ron, “what
can I — ?”

“What you can say is, ‘We promise we’ll never leave our homework this
late again,’” she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but she
looked slightly amused all the same.

“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said Harry weakly, passing over his essay
and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the
three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermione’s
quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle
of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across
the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in
his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with
the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.

He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even
mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to
him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like
that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop
him and even to tell tales on him to Umbridge, that made his situation real
to him as nothing else had. He had known Percy for four years, had stayed
in his house during the summers, shared a tent with him during the
Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the
second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought
him unbalanced and possibly violent.

And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought that Sirius
was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he
felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; nearly
everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a
great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for
fourteen years. . . .

Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could not have
been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No . . . it
could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because he had been thinking
about Sirius. . . .

“Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a
sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy out this
conclusion that I’ve written for you.”
“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,”
said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again —”

“— I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione. “Harry, yours is
okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor
Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — Harry?”
Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching on the
singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.

“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you down there?”
“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said Harry.
He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s head in this very fire
the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could not be sure
that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so quickly. . . .
“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeated. “You mean like when he wanted to
talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn’t do that now,
it would be too — Sirius!”

She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the middle
of the dancing flames sat Sirius’s head, long dark hair falling around his
grinning face.

“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had
disappeared,” he said. “I’ve been checking every hour.”
“You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry said, half
laughing.

“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.”
“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got a
glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as Hermione
clapped a hand to her mouth. “I was gone the moment she looked back at
me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something.”
“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —” Hermione began.
“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius. “This was the only way I could
come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a code — and
codes are breakable.”

At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron had both turned to
stare at him.
“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said Hermione accusingly.
“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in
the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind. “Don’t look at
me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret
information out of it, was there, Sirius?”

“No, it was very good,” said Sirius, smiling. “Anyway, we’d better be
quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.”
“What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, “We’ll tell you
afterward, go on, Sirius.”

“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s
anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn’t it?”
“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was
feeling a powerful emotion,” said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and
Hermione’s winces. “So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or
something the night I had that detention.”

“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” said Sirius.
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me
when I was in detention with her?” Harry asked.
“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know her by reputation and I’m sure she’s no
Death Eater —”

“She’s foul enough to be one,” said Harry darkly and Ron and Hermione
nodded vigorously in agreement.
“Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters,” said
Sirius with a wry smile. “I know she’s a nasty piece of work, though — you
should hear Remus talk about her.”

“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge’s
comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first lesson.
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two
years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.”
Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his
dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.

“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione angrily.
“Scared of them, I expect,” said Sirius, smiling at her indignation.
“Apparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople
rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and energy
persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the
loose —”

Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.
“Sirius!” she said reproachfully. “Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort
with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only member of
his family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said —”
“So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius interrupted. “Is she
training you all to kill half-breeds?”

“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look at being cut off in
her defense of Kreacher. “She’s not letting us use magic at all!”
“All we do is read the stupid textbook,” said Ron.
“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information from inside the
Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat.”
“Trained in combat?” repeated Harry incredulously. “What does he think
we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?”

“That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather,
that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his own
private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.”
There was a pause at this, then Ron said, “That’s the stupidest thing I’ve
ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.”
“So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts
because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said
Hermione, looking furious.

“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to
seize power. He’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It’s
a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up
charge.”

This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter.
“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in the
Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there will be
—”

“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone from the Order all
weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just been Kreacher and me here . . .”
There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s voice.
“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?”

“Ah . . .” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one’s
sure what’s happened to him.” Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added
quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three get yourselves
in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.”
“But if he was supposed to be back by now  .  .  .” said Hermione in a
small, worried voice.

“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch with her and she
says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s nothing to
suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly okay.”
Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,” said Sirius
hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s not back,
and I know Dumbledore doesn’t want that. Hagrid’s tough, he’ll be okay.”
And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, “When’s your
next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the
dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I thought I could —”
“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.

“Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, “they’re always guessing where I am,
they haven’t really got a clue —”
“Yeah, but we think this time they have,” said Harry. “Something Malfoy
said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on
the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so don’t come up here,
whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you again —”

“All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius. He looked most
displeased. “Just an idea, thought you might like to get together —”
“I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said Harry.
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease
between his sunken eyes.

“You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a definite
coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.”
“Look —”
“Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,”
said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. “I’ll write to tell you a time I
can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?”
There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius’s head had been was
flickering flame once more.


CHAPTER ONE

THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
into his car and backed out of number four's drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking
of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now
reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in
funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...
yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad
daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never
seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made
several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs
and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't
know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on
his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
caught a few words of what they were saying.

"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better
of it.

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost
finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all
the same, those people in cloaks...

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that
he walked straight into someone just outside the door.

"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the
ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in
a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,
happy day!"

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that
was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
didn't approve of imagination.

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that
morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.

"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a
stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying
to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When
Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news:

"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally
hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been
hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin.
"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"

"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister
lately, have you?"

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.

"No," she said sharply. "Why?"

"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting
stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."

"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.

"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you
know... her crowd."

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he
didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --
he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"

"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"

"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."

"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite
agree."

He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom
window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something.

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of
-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting
thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were
involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over
-- it couldn't affect them....

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the
next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the
ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,
a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon
spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to
realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,
which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
muttered, "I should have known."

He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and
clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He
clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times
he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed
Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his
cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down
on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he
spoke to it.

"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was
wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight
bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.

"How did you know it was me?" she asked.

"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."

"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said
Professor McGonagall.

"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here."

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles
have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her
head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks
of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They
were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet
that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."

"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
little to celebrate for eleven years."

"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on
the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,
swapping rumors."

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping
he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A
fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have
disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he
really has gone, Dumbledore?"

"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"

"A what?"

"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"

"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't
think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if
You-Know-Who has gone -"

"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I
have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so
confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason
to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're
the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."

"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
never have."

"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."

"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmuffs."

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls
are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what
everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally
stopped him?"

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard
wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
another lemon drop and did not answer.

"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is
that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...
Oh, Albus..."

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
know..." he said heavily.

Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all.
They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he
couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,
but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.

Dumbledore nodded glumly.

"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?
It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the
name of heaven did Harry survive?"

"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.
It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because
he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was
he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"

"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to
tell me why you're here, of all places?"

"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
he has left now."

"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.
"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't
find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw
him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
Harry Potter come and live here!"

"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've
written them a letter."

"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a
letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a
legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child
in our world will know his name!"

"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous
before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even
remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away
from all that until he's ready to take it?"

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and
then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she
thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

"Hagrid's bringing him."

"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
this?"

I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.

"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
tend to -- what was that?"

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and
a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of
them.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times
as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands
the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were
like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
of blankets.

"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did
you get that motorcycle?"

"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing
carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to
me. I've got him, sir."

"No problems, were there?"

"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right
before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was
flyin' over Bristol."

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a
tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously
shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.

"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever."

"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"

"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself
above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well
-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.

"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a
wounded dog.

"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"

"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and
burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead
-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"

"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out
of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to
the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall
blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.

"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."

"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose
into the air and off into the night.

"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the
bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish
of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside
him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was
famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy
who lived!"


CAHPTER TWO

THE VANISHING GLASS

Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at
all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living
room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
the first noise of the day.

"Up! Get up! Now!"

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his
back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny
feeling he'd had the same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

"Are you up yet?" she demanded.

"Nearly," said Harry.

"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."

Harry groaned.

"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.

"Nothing, nothing..."

Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,
after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to
spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and
that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a
racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's
favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry
didn't look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry
had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He
wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry
liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that
was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
Petunia was how he had gotten it.

"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
questions."

Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
than the rest of the boys in his class put

together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
all over the place.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,
not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay
smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
pig in a wig.

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.
His face fell.

"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two
less than last year."

"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."

"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down
his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's
that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''

Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."

"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.

"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right
then."

Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.

"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't
take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction.

Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every
year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the
day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two
streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever
owned.

"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd
planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be
a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
Tufty again.

"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.

"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."

The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't
there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't
understand them, like a slug.

"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"

"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia.

"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to
watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
on Dudley's computer).

Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.

"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled.

"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.

"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
and leave him in the car...."

"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."

Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up
his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.

"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special
day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him.

"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge,
pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty
grin through the gap in his mother's arms.

Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers
Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their
backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in
the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the
zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able
to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside.

"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up
close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until
Christmas."

"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..

But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.

The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was
just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which
she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly
at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,
where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she
tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to
his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.

On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as
usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was
sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash
cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have
caught him in mid- jump.

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with
Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,
his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the
bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
it was motorcycles.

"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a
motorcycle overtook them.

I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It
was flying."

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet
with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"

Dudley and Piers sniggered.

I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."

But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking
about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a
dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous
ideas.

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap
lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
except that it wasn't blond.

Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to
walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who
were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall
back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo
restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
last.

After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts
of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,
man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in
the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the
glistening brown coils.

"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
glass, but the snake didn't budge.

"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.

"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no
company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a
bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised
its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.

It winked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised
its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:

"I get that all the time.

"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the
snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."

The snake nodded vigorously.

"Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
peered at it.

Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

"Was it nice there?"

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
Brazil?"

As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
them jump.

"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT IT'S DOING!"

Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.

"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by
surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with
howls of horror.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and
started running for the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.

"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"

The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea
while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only
gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except
snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were
all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had
nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers
calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,
Harry?"

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to
say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a
chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.

Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He
didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were
asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen
for some food.

He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as
long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents
had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when
his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long
hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding
flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he
supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green
light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and
uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask
questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)
that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers
they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and
then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these
people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a
closer look.

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.
